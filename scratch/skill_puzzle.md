Idea: skill-based refresher flash-quiz game

* Topics and Question Database:
  * Generate on demand using LLMs based on user-selected topics
  * Ability to ground/reference a document collection
  * Question validation should be tracked, allowing verification and diputes by user, agents, and experts
* Questions and results should support rich types:
  * Text
  * Markdown
  * Mathjax
  * Mermaid
  * Code snippets with syntax highlighting
* Types of questions:
  * Simple (fast-touch interface questions)
    * multiple choice
    * multiple true/false
    * Multi-multi match questions (e.g. "Link the following terms to their definitions")
  * Free-answer (must include rubric for auto-grading)
    * Coding (free answer + solution code + test cases)
* Adaptive difficulty:
  * Questions should adapt in difficulty based on user performance
  * The quizzer should generate a topic-specific score that is used for further testing, feedback, and dashboarding
  * Topic/difficulty may be visible, may be selectable, depending on system config
  * Answers should be selected from a pool of plausible distractors generated by the LLM for repeatability
  * Answers should list why they are correct/incorrect after each question
* Adaptive difficulty engine:
  * Questions are tagged with various topic tags tied to difficulty ratings
  * Adaptive testing involves building a robust model of the user's skill levels, refining that model by querying high-uncertianty questions
  * Every e.g. 5 questions, the system should re-evaluate the user's skill model and find the next best question to ask
  * Modelling method may vary
