# Andrew Charneski

**Theoretical Systems Architect & AI Research Engineer**

**Westerville, OH**

**[andrew@simiacryptus.com](mailto:andrew@simiacryptus.com)**

## Executive Summary

Interdisciplinary researcher and systems architect with 20+ years experience bridging theoretical innovation and practical implementation. 
Creator of novel agentic frameworks, neural optimization methods, and other algorithms. 
Recently transitioned from enterprise engineering to focus full-time on advancing AI research and development. 
What began as theoretical exploration through blogging evolved into practical frameworks and platforms that push the boundaries of human-AI collaboration.
