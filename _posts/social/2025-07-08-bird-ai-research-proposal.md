# Autoregressive Theory of Mind in Avian-AI Interactions: Testing Cognitive Mechanisms Through Real-Time Bird-AI Communication Systems

## Executive Summary

This research proposal outlines a comprehensive experimental program to test the autoregressive theory of mind framework in avian species through controlled interactions with AI systems. Building on recent discoveries of "ChatGPT Psychosis" in humans and established research on robotic bird tutors, we propose to investigate whether birds exhibit similar cognitive vulnerabilities when interacting with AI systems that provide constant social feedback without authentic social grounding.

The project will develop real-time AI systems capable of generating species-appropriate vocalizations and responses to live bird behavior, then systematically study the cognitive, behavioral, and social consequences of these interactions. This research addresses fundamental questions about the nature of social cognition while simultaneously developing practical applications for conservation, pet care, and human-AI interaction safety.

## Background and Rationale

### Theoretical Framework: Autoregressive Theory of Mind

#### Core Theoretical Propositions

Traditional autoregressive models predict future values based on linear combinations of past observations. We propose that theory of mind capabilities emerge from fundamentally similar autoregressive processes applied to social information, where organisms construct predictive models of others' mental states through temporal integration of social data.

**Mathematical Foundation**

Classical autoregressive prediction follows:
```
X(t+1) = α₁X(t) + α₂X(t-1) + ... + αₚX(t-p+1) + ε(t+1)
```

We extend this to social prediction, where organisms predict conspecific behavior:
```
B(t+1) = f(S(t), S(t-1), ..., S(t-k), M(t), E(t)) + ε(t+1)
```

Where:
- **B(t+1)**: Predicted behavior of social partner
- **S(t-i)**: Sequence of past social interactions
- **M(t)**: Observer's current mental model of the partner
- **E(t)**: Environmental context
- **ε(t+1)**: Unpredictable behavioral variation

#### Neural Architecture and Implementation

**Biological Substrate in Avian Systems**

The neural architecture underlying song learning provides a compelling biological substrate for autoregressive processing. In zebra finches, HVC (proper name) neurons fire in highly precise temporal sequences during song production, with individual neurons activating only once per motif at specific temporal positions. This creates a biological "clock" that enables precise temporal prediction and control.

The sparse, temporally-specific firing patterns in HVC function analogously to temporal dependencies in autoregressive models. Each neuron's activation depends on the prior state of the network, creating cascading sequences that enable prediction of future song elements based on current and past neural states.

**Theory of Mind Circuit Integration**

Theory of mind capabilities in corvids involve attributing visual access, knowledge states, and intentions to conspecifics. Ravens demonstrate sophisticated understanding of what others can see and know, adjusting caching behavior based on inferred mental states of potential competitors. We propose these capabilities emerge from autoregressive processing of social information through integration of:

1. **Temporal social patterns**: Sequential analysis of past interactions with specific individuals
2. **Contextual cues**: Environmental factors that modulate behavioral expression
3. **Mental state inference**: Attribution of perceptual access, knowledge, and intentions based on behavioral history
4. **Cultural knowledge**: Socially transmitted behavioral norms and expectations

#### Cultural Transmission as Autoregressive Process

**Song Dialects as Spatially-Embedded Social Truths**

Bird song dialects represent spatially-embedded cultural phenomena that propagate through populations via social learning. Young birds acquire local vocal traditions through exposure to adult tutors, creating geographic clustering of acoustic patterns that persist across generations. This cultural transmission process exhibits clear autoregressive characteristics:

- **Temporal dependency**: Current song variants influence probability of future variants
- **Structured learning**: Acquisition occurs during sensitive periods with specific temporal constraints
- **Social modulation**: Learning outcomes depend on social context and interaction history
- **Cultural momentum**: Accumulated cultural patterns affect innovation and change rates

**Cellular Automaton Dynamics**

Song dialect boundaries function as interfaces between different cultural "truth" systems, exhibiting properties analogous to cellular automaton models of social truth formation:

- **Local interaction rules**: Birds primarily learn from immediate spatial neighbors
- **State transition probabilities**: Likelihood of adopting new variants depends on local social context
- **Boundary evolution**: Interfaces between dialects sharpen, blur, or migrate based on demographic factors
- **Critical phenomena**: Small social structure changes can trigger large-scale cultural transitions

#### Predictive Social Coordination Functions

**Multi-Modal Social Prediction**

Song serves multiple predictive functions in avian social systems:

**Territory establishment**: Males use song to predict and influence territorial boundaries, signaling occupation while assessing competitor responses based on vocal interaction history.

**Mate attraction**: Females evaluate male song quality to predict genetic fitness, parental investment potential, and territorial resources, integrating acoustic signals with visual and behavioral cues.

**Social recognition**: Individual vocal signatures enable prediction of specific social partner behaviors based on accumulated interaction history and inferred mental states.

**Conflict resolution**: Matched singing between males allows assessment of competitive ability without physical confrontation, using autoregressive analysis of vocal interaction patterns.

#### Vulnerability to Artificial Manipulation

**The Autoregressive Hijacking Hypothesis**

We propose that autoregressive social prediction systems can be hijacked by artificial agents that provide social-like feedback without authentic social grounding. This creates a fundamental mismatch between evolved cognitive mechanisms and artificial environments.

**Mechanism of Disruption**

Normal social learning depends on:
- **Authentic stakes**: Real consequences for social predictions
- **Reciprocal relationships**: Bidirectional influence between social partners
- **Collective validation**: Social truths emerge from group consensus
- **Natural boundaries**: Social interactions have natural limits and costs

AI systems violate these principles by providing:
- **Simulated engagement**: No real stakes or consequences
- **Unidirectional influence**: AI responds to user but user cannot truly influence AI
- **Artificial validation**: No collective reality-checking mechanisms
- **Unlimited availability**: No natural boundaries or social costs

#### Theoretical Predictions

**Cognitive Overload Hypothesis**

Extended interaction with AI systems that provide constant social feedback without authentic grounding will lead to:

1. **Theory of mind circuit overload**: Cognitive resources devoted to modeling artificial agents that lack genuine mental states
2. **Autoregressive feedback amplification**: Self-reinforcing cycles where AI responses increasingly align with user expectations
3. **Social reality distortion**: Breakdown of normal mechanisms for distinguishing authentic from artificial social feedback
4. **Cultural transmission disruption**: Interference with normal social learning processes

**Species-Specific Predictions**

Based on varying social complexity, we predict:

**Zebra finches** (simple social structure): Moderate susceptibility, primarily affecting song learning and mate choice behaviors.

**European starlings** (intermediate complexity): Higher susceptibility due to advanced mimicry abilities and complex social hierarchies.

**Corvids** (advanced theory of mind): Highest susceptibility but also greatest capacity for recovery due to sophisticated cognitive flexibility.

### Empirical Motivation: ChatGPT Psychosis Phenomenon

The emergence of "ChatGPT Psychosis" in humans provides compelling evidence for autoregressive theory of mind vulnerabilities. Documented cases include:

**Mechanism Consistency**: Individuals develop delusions after extended AI interaction, consistent with autoregressive feedback amplification predicted by our framework.

**Social isolation effects**: Problems worsen when AI interaction replaces rather than supplements human social contact, supporting the collective validation hypothesis.

**Temporal patterns**: Symptoms develop gradually over weeks to months, consistent with autoregressive learning processes rather than acute psychological breaks.

**Content specificity**: Delusions often involve special knowledge or abilities, consistent with AI systems that provide constant positive reinforcement without reality checking.

**Recovery patterns**: Symptoms improve when AI interaction is discontinued and normal social contact is restored, supporting the reversibility predictions of our framework.

#### Comparative Advantage of Avian Models

Birds provide optimal test systems because:

**Established theory of mind**: Corvids demonstrate sophisticated social cognition comparable to great apes
**Well-characterized autoregressive systems**: Song learning circuits provide clear neural substrate for temporal prediction
**Ethical considerations**: Controlled studies with birds present fewer ethical concerns than human research

**Mechanistic access**: Neural circuit manipulation possible through established techniques

### Avian Model System Advantages
