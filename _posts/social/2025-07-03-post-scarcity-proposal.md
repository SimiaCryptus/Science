As automation and artificial intelligence approach the potential for material post-scarcity, existing economic theory provides limited guidance for understanding the resulting equilibrium conditions and transition dynamics. This proposal outlines a comprehensive computational modeling framework to analyze post-scarcity economic systems, focusing on persistent constraints, emergent equilibria, and the evolutionary dynamics of institutional arrangements. Through agent-based modeling, game-theoretic analysis, and evolutionary algorithms, we aim to identify stable configurations for post-material-scarcity societies and the conditions under which they emerge.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

The prospect of post-scarcity economics—where material goods become so abundant that traditional economic models based on resource limitations break down—is transitioning from science fiction to policy consideration. Current discussions of automation, universal basic income, and technological unemployment reflect growing recognition that fundamental economic assumptions may soon require revision.
Recent advances in physics research, particularly in areas like quantum-coherent nuclear fusion (
see [superfluid_fusion_proposal.md](../scifi/2025-06-29-superfluid-fusion-proposal.md)), suggest that material abundance through
novel energy and matter synthesis may arrive sooner than anticipated.

However, existing analyses of post-scarcity scenarios suffer from three critical limitations: (1) insufficient attention to persistent constraints that remain binding even under material abundance, (2) lack of systematic analysis of possible equilibrium configurations and their stability properties, and (3) inadequate consideration of transition dynamics and path-dependent outcomes.

This research addresses these gaps through computational modeling that explicitly incorporates multiple constraint types, allows for complex agent interactions, and simulates evolutionary dynamics across institutional arrangements.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Persistent Constraints in Post-Scarcity Systems

Even under conditions of material abundance, several categories of constraints remain binding:

**Thermodynamic Constraints**: Energy requirements and entropy increases create ultimate limits on production and consumption, establishing boundary conditions for any post-scarcity equilibrium.

**Spatial and Temporal Constraints**: Location-specific advantages, proximity effects, and finite human lifespans create inherent scarcities that resist technological solutions.

**Cognitive and Attention Constraints**: Human information processing limitations, decision-making capacity, and attention spans create bottlenecks in complex systems.

**Coordination and Information Constraints**: The computational and social overhead of coordinating large-scale systems creates scaling limits independent of material resources.

**Social and Preference Constraints**: Status competition, cultural heterogeneity, and preference evolution create new forms of scarcity and conflict even under material abundance.
**Information and Reality Constraints**: As explored in [managed[managed_reality_paper.md](./2025-06-30-managed-reality-paper.md)nagement of information environments becomes a critical constraint in post-scarcity societies where traditional
economic pressures no longer organize human behavior.

### 2.2 Potential Equilibrium Configurations

Our framework considers multiple possible equilibrium states:

* **Labor-leisure equilibria** where creative activity and leisure optimization become primary
* **Status competition equilibria** focused on positional goods and social hierarchy
* **Innovation-driven equilibria** organized around research and novel experience creation  
* **Curated reality equilibria** where information management systems shape distinct economic experiences (

## 4. Research Questions

1. **Constraint Analysis**: Which categories of constraints remain most binding under different levels of material abundance, and how do constraint interactions shape equilibrium possibilities?

2. **Equilibrium Stability**: Under what conditions do different post-scarcity equilibria emerge and remain stable? What factors drive transitions between equilibrium states?

3. **Transition Dynamics**: How do path-dependent factors and existing institutional arrangements influence trajectories toward post-scarcity conditions?

## 8. Broader Impacts

This research addresses fundamental questions about the future of human economic organization as technological capabilities approach post-scarcity conditions. The computational framework will provide policymakers, technologists, and social planners with tools to anticipate and influence transitions toward more equitable and stable economic arrangements.

Beyond immediate policy applications, this work contributes to our understanding of complex adaptive systems, institutional evolution, and the relationship between technological capability and social organization. The methodological innovations may prove applicable to other domains involving large-scale social and economic transitions.

As societies worldwide grapple with automation, inequality, and technological displacement, systematic analysis of post-scarcity possibilities becomes increasingly crucial for informed decision-making about our economic future.
