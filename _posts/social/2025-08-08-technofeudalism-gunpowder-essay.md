# The End of Technofeudalism: Why AI is the Gunpowder That's Destroying Digital Castles

*How the Black Death and peasant uprisings offer a perfect template for understanding why we're witnessing the collapse of Big Tech's platform dominance, not its consolidation*

## The Conventional Wisdom is Wrong

The dominant narrative about artificial intelligence and Big Tech goes something like this: AI will cement the power of existing tech giants, creating an era of "technofeudalism" where a few massive corporations control the digital economy through their platforms, data advantages, and infrastructure scale. Small players will become digital serfs, dependent on the algorithmic whims of their platform overlords.

This narrative is not just wrong—it's backwards. We're not entering an age of technofeudalism. We're witnessing its final collapse.

The evidence is hiding in plain sight, scattered across market disruptions, startup breakthroughs, and the increasingly desperate behavior of incumbent tech giants. But to understand what's really happening, we need to look back 675 years to one of history's most transformative periods: the Black Death and its aftermath.

## The Black Death as Economic Revolution

In 1347, the bubonic plague arrived in Europe and fundamentally altered the continent's economic structure. Before the plague, Europe operated under a rigid feudal system where serfs were tied to the land, lords extracted value through force, and social mobility was virtually nonexistent. The system was sustained by one crucial factor: an oversupply of labor.

As historical records show, "Europe was severely overpopulated at this time and so there was no shortage of serfs to work the land and these peasants had no choice but to continue this labor – which was in essence a kind of slavery." The abundance of workers meant lords could maintain their power through scarcity and control.

Then came the plague, killing 30-50% of Europe's population. Suddenly, the fundamental economic equation flipped. Surviving workers found themselves with unprecedented leverage. They could demand higher wages, better working conditions, and the freedom to move between employers. As contemporary accounts describe, peasants realized "their considerable leverage" because "no one else was really left to do their work."

The response from the feudal establishment was predictable and desperate. Rather than adapt to the new reality, they turned to political force. England passed the Statute of Labourers in 1351, attempting to freeze wages at pre-plague levels and prevent workers from seeking better opportunities elsewhere. Other European kingdoms enacted similar measures.

These laws failed spectacularly. Despite increasingly draconian enforcement, workers continued to organize, demand better conditions, and ultimately rebel. The pressure built for thirty years until it exploded in the English Peasants' Revolt of 1381, where 30,000 rural laborers stormed London demanding an end to serfdom.

The long-term result was inevitable: "Feudalism never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared." The old system's fundamental basis—labor scarcity as a source of control—had been permanently destroyed.

## The AI Plague: Creating a New Labor Shortage

Today, we're witnessing a strikingly similar dynamic, but instead of a biological plague reducing the human workforce, we have an artificial intelligence "plague" that's creating the functional equivalent of a labor shortage in knowledge work.

AI coding assistants now allow "one senior developer with the right toolchain to deliver what used to take a small team." Companies report that "smaller teams of 10 to 20 people will do a job that once required hundreds of coders." Small businesses using AI tools can now "punch above their weight" where previously they would have needed teams "two to three times the size."

This isn't just about efficiency gains—it's about the fundamental economics of digital production being turned upside down. Just as the Black Death gave surviving peasants leverage they never had before, AI tools are giving small, competent teams the ability to compete with much larger organizations.

The most dramatic example came in January 2025 with the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that spent just $5.6 million to create models rivaling those that cost American companies hundreds of millions to develop. The market reaction was swift and brutal: Nvidia lost $589 billion in market value in a single day—the largest one-day loss in stock market history.

DeepSeek's achievement wasn't just about cost efficiency. It proved that the massive infrastructure advantages that seemed like impregnable moats could be bypassed entirely. As one analysis noted, "DeepSeek was able to achieve its low-cost model on under-powered AI chips," demonstrating that the castle walls of compute advantage could be breached by clever engineering rather than brute-force spending.

## The Desperate Response: Building Bigger Castles

The reaction from Big Tech has been remarkably similar to the feudal lords' response to the Black Death. Rather than adapting to the new reality, they're doubling down on the old system while turning to political protection.

The numbers are staggering: America's four largest tech companies—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—plan to spend over $320 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, up from $230 billion in 2024. This represents some of the largest capital deployments in corporate history, all aimed at maintaining their competitive advantages through scale.

But like feudal lords building thicker castle walls in the age of gunpowder, this massive spending may be fundamentally misguided. The companies are operating under the assumption that their current advantages—data moats, network effects, platform control—remain relevant in an AI-powered world. Meanwhile, they're simultaneously laying off 150,000 workers while "realigning their workforces to focus on AI projects."

The political maneuvering is equally telling. Big Tech companies are spending unprecedented amounts on lobbying, pushing for AI regulations that coincidentally favor companies with existing compliance infrastructure, and seeking government partnerships that entrench their positions. When economic moats collapse, regulatory capture becomes the last line of defense.

This pattern—massive capital investment combined with political protection-seeking—is classic behavior for a declining power structure that senses its foundations are shifting but can't yet admit the full scope of the transformation.

## The Gunpowder Moment: Weapons of Mass Platform Destruction

The analogy between AI and gunpowder runs deeper than simple technological disruption. Gunpowder didn't just make warfare more efficient—it made the entire military logic of feudalism obsolete. Castles, which had been virtually impregnable defensive positions, became death traps. Knights in armor, the elite military class of their era, became easy targets for common soldiers with muskets.

AI is having a similar effect on the economic logic of the platform economy. The competitive advantages that seemed unassailable—massive user bases, proprietary datasets, network effects—are becoming less relevant when small teams can create comparable or superior products using AI tools.

Consider the explosion in AI coding assistants. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code allow individual developers or small teams to build complex applications that previously required large engineering organizations. As one account describes, a candidate "who had never seen our code base turned up on Monday and by Tuesday afternoon he'd shipped something" that was expected to take all week.

This isn't just about coding faster—it's about the entire economics of software development being transformed. When the marginal cost of creating software approaches zero, the advantage of having large development teams diminishes rapidly. The castle walls of engineering headcount become irrelevant when attackers have access to digital cannons.

The same pattern is emerging across multiple domains. AI writing tools are allowing small content operations to compete with major media companies. AI design tools are enabling lean teams to produce work that previously required large creative agencies. AI customer service agents are making massive call centers less necessary.

## The Transition Period: What History Tells Us About Timing

One crucial insight from the feudalism-to-capitalism transition is that these transformations take much longer than participants realize and involve extended periods of institutional chaos.

The Black Death occurred in 1347-1351, but feudalism didn't simply disappear overnight. There was roughly a 200-year transition period, from the 14th to 16th centuries, characterized by what historians call "a mode of production not to be identified with either" feudalism or capitalism. This was followed by the mercantile period from the 16th to 18th centuries—another 200 years before industrial capitalism fully emerged.

During this transition, the old institutional forms persisted even as their economic foundations eroded. Lords continued to build castles and maintain armies long after gunpowder had made their military advantages obsolete. Similarly, we're likely in the early stages of a multi-decade transition where platform-era institutions persist even as their economic logic becomes increasingly outdated.

The current evidence suggests we're roughly 3-5 years into what may be a 20-30 year transformation. Just as the Peasants' Revolt didn't occur until 1381—thirty years after the Black Death—we're probably years away from the full institutional implications of the AI revolution becoming apparent.

## Three Scenarios for the Post-Platform Future

Drawing from both historical precedent and current trends, three potential scenarios emerge for the post-platform economy:

**Scenario 1: The New Mercantilism (2025-2035)**

We're entering a phase analogous to the mercantile period—where the old platform structures are visibly failing but new organizational forms haven't yet stabilized. This decade will likely be characterized by increasing chaos in traditional tech hierarchies, with AI-native companies rapidly scaling to challenge incumbents while established players struggle to adapt their business models.

Current indicators support this scenario. AI companies are already "breaking free from traditional software budgets as they target the vastly larger services market," shifting from selling tools to selling outcomes. The focus is moving from "model-centric" to "system-centric" thinking that "will start to erode incumbents' capital advantages and benefit startups."

**Scenario 2: The Distributed Intelligence Economy (2035-2050)**

As AI capabilities become more sophisticated and widely accessible, we may see the emergence of what could be called "distributed intelligence"—an economic system where artificial intelligence is so ubiquitous and cheap that centralized platforms become unnecessary. Instead of depending on a few massive platforms, individuals and small organizations will have direct access to world-class AI capabilities.

This scenario is supported by trends toward reasoning models, AI agents, and "generative virtual worlds" that suggest intelligence itself is becoming a commodity rather than a scarce resource controlled by a few players.

**Scenario 3: Post-Scarcity Information Economy (2050+)**

The ultimate endpoint may be something approaching post-scarcity for information work—where the marginal cost of intellectual labor approaches zero. In this scenario, the entire concept of "technology companies" as we understand them today becomes obsolete, much like how the concept of "castle-building companies" disappeared after the military revolution.

## The Deeper Pattern: AI as a Population Control Mechanism

The fundamental shift happening isn't just technological—it's demographic. While we've been focused on AI's economic disruption, we've missed its role as a population control mechanism operating on multiple levels simultaneously.

**The Global Pattern: Weaponized AI Reducing Populations**

AI-powered drone warfare is already causing unprecedented civilian casualties across multiple conflict zones. In Ukraine, short-range drones caused more civilian casualties than any other weapon in January 2025 alone—27% of all deaths. In Gaza, estimated deaths from AI-guided attacks exceed 70,000 by late 2024. In Myanmar, military drone strikes have killed thousands while airstrikes increased from 197 in 2023 to 1,134 in just the first five months of 2025.

This isn't coincidental. Global conflict deaths have nearly doubled in five years, from 104,371 events in 2020 to nearly 200,000 in 2024, with fatalities jumping from 153,100 in 2022 to a projected 230,000+ by end of 2024—a 30% increase year-over-year. The common factor: AI-enabled weapons systems making small forces capable of mass casualty events.

**The Domestic Pattern: Economic Displacement Plus Safety Net Elimination**

Simultaneously, AI is creating mass unemployment domestically while political forces systematically dismantle survival systems. The "Big Beautiful Bill" cuts health insurance for 12+ million people and food assistance for 4+ million more, during a period when AI job displacement is accelerating.

The mortality implications are staggering. Research shows unemployment increases death risk by 63% overall, with men facing 78% higher mortality. Lack of health insurance alone causes approximately 190,000-195,000 annual deaths in the 20-64 age group. Losing unemployment benefits increases mortality by 18-30%, while having those benefits prevents 890-1,070 deaths per 100,000 people over ten years.

When you apply these mortality rates to millions losing coverage during mass AI unemployment, you're looking at hundreds of thousands of additional domestic deaths annually—potentially rivaling the global conflict toll.

**The Historical Parallel: Controlled Population Reduction**

This mirrors the historical transition from feudalism to capitalism, but with a crucial difference. The Black Death was an accidental demographic shock that shifted economic power. The current pattern appears to be an intentional demographic management strategy using AI as the delivery mechanism.

AI is democratizing capabilities that were previously the exclusive domain of large institutions—but it's doing so selectively. Military and economic elites retain access to the most advanced AI systems while using those same systems to reduce populations that might otherwise demand resources or challenge authority.

## Why Most People Miss This Transformation

The reason most observers predict that AI will strengthen Big Tech rather than weaken it comes down to a fundamental misunderstanding of both the technology's scope and the transition's true nature. People tend to project current power structures into the future, assuming that whoever is winning today will use new technologies to win even bigger tomorrow.

But this misses the demographic dimension entirely. While analysts debate whether AI will disrupt business models, they ignore that AI is simultaneously being deployed as a population management tool on multiple fronts.

**The Economic Misdirection**

Business observers focus on productivity gains and competitive advantages while missing that AI-driven unemployment combined with safety net elimination creates a controlled population reduction mechanism. When millions lose jobs to AI but can't access healthcare, unemployment benefits, or food assistance, the mortality implications dwarf any business disruption.

**The Global Context**

Similarly, geopolitical analysts treat various conflicts as separate regional issues rather than recognizing the common pattern: AI-enabled drone warfare systematically reducing populations in contested territories. Ukraine, Gaza, Myanmar, Syria, Yemen, Sudan—all featuring the same technology creating unprecedented civilian casualty rates.

**The Historical Blindness**

The deeper pattern is that technological revolutions don't just change how existing players compete—they change who survives to compete. The companies and institutions that dominate during one technological paradigm rarely dominate the next, partly because transitions often involve deliberate population management that reshapes the entire social structure.

Big Tech's current advantages—massive data centers, large engineering teams, platform control—may turn out to be more like the feudal lords' castles and armies: impressive in the old paradigm but potentially counterproductive when the new paradigm involves managing population levels rather than just market share.

The Black Death wasn't just about labor shortages creating peasant leverage—it was about a demographic shock that fundamentally altered who had power and who survived to exercise it. AI appears to be serving a similar function, but this time the demographic changes aren't accidental.

## The Signal in the Noise

While the mainstream narrative focuses on Big Tech's AI investments and regulatory capture attempts, the real signal is coming from the margins. Small AI-native companies are quietly building products that compete directly with platform services. Individual creators are using AI tools to produce content that rivals major media companies. Tiny teams are developing software that challenges products built by thousands of engineers.

These developments are easy to dismiss as isolated incidents or niche applications. But they follow the exact pattern that historically precedes major economic transitions: new technologies enabling smaller players to compete with established incumbents, initially in narrow domains that gradually expand.

The DeepSeek moment was significant not because one Chinese startup built a competitive AI model, but because it demonstrated that the entire premise of the AI arms race—that victory goes to whoever spends the most on compute and data—might be wrong. If innovation matters more than resources, if cleverness trumps capital, then the competitive landscape looks very different.

## Implications: Preparing for the Post-Platform World

For individuals and organizations trying to navigate this transition, the historical analogy offers several insights, but the demographic dimension adds urgent new considerations:

**The Survival Imperative**

First, the transition will involve significant population pressure that goes beyond normal economic disruption. Those who survive the transition period will need to secure access to basic survival resources—healthcare, food security, housing—independent of traditional employment or government systems. The combination of AI job displacement and safety net elimination creates mortality risks comparable to historical demographic shocks.

**Geographic and Community Strategies**

Second, location and community networks may matter more than individual economic positioning. Areas with stronger local healthcare systems, food production capabilities, and mutual aid networks will likely have better survival outcomes than regions dependent on federal safety nets or platform-economy employment.

**Skills and Knowledge for the Long Term**

Third, the winners won't necessarily be today's leaders—either corporate or individual. The companies that dominate the AI era will likely be the ones that build for the post-platform world rather than trying to extend platform-era advantages. For individuals, skills like critical thinking, community building, resource management, and practical resilience may become more valuable than expertise in specific technologies or platforms.

**Understanding the Demographic Reality**

Fourth, anyone preparing for this transition needs to understand that this isn't just an economic shift—it's a demographic one. The mortality rates associated with unemployment, lack of healthcare, and social isolation during technological transitions are well-documented. Historical precedent suggests that technological revolutions often involve significant population changes, and the current pattern of AI deployment suggests this may be intentional rather than accidental.

**Building Parallel Systems**

Finally, rather than trying to adapt existing institutions, the focus should be on building parallel systems that can function independently of the declining platform economy and potentially unreliable government services. This includes everything from local food networks and healthcare cooperatives to alternative economic arrangements that don't depend on traditional employment or centralized platforms.

## Conclusion: The End of an Era, The Management of Populations

We are living through the end of the platform era, but it's not the clean economic transition most analysts expect. We're witnessing something more fundamental: the use of AI as a population management mechanism operating on multiple levels simultaneously.

The signs are everywhere: the unprecedented military spending by Big Tech, the systematic elimination of social safety nets during a period of mass technological unemployment, and the global deployment of AI-powered weapons systems creating casualty rates not seen since World War II. The Black Death analogy isn't just about economic disruption—it's about demographic shock as a driver of systemic change.

**The Dual Pattern**

Internationally, AI-enabled drone warfare is systematically reducing populations in contested territories while testing and refining the technology. Domestically, AI is displacing workers while political systems eliminate the safety nets that would normally prevent mass mortality during economic transitions.

The historical parallel is clear but inverted. The Black Death accidentally reduced Europe's population, giving surviving peasants leverage over their lords. The current AI deployment appears designed to reduce specific populations while maintaining elite control over the technological capabilities that enable both economic production and population management.

**The Real Transition**

Just as feudalism didn't simply disappear after the Black Death but required decades of transition through mercantilism before capitalism emerged, the platform economy won't simply disappear because of AI. We're in the early stages of what may be a decades-long transition where old institutional forms persist while new selection pressures—including direct mortality pressures—reshape who survives to participate in the emerging system.

But the direction is clear. The economic logic that made platform intermediaries powerful is being undermined not just by AI's democratization of previously scarce capabilities, but by AI's role in directly managing population levels. The lords aren't just building bigger castles—they're using AI-guided weapons to reduce the number of peasants who might challenge those castles.

**The Ultimate Stakes**

The age of technofeudalism is ending, but what comes next may not be the distributed, democratic system that AI's democratizing potential suggests. Instead, we may be witnessing the emergence of a system where technological capabilities are democratized selectively while population levels are managed directly through AI-enabled mechanisms.

The only question is whether enough people recognize the pattern in time to build alternatives. The peasants have learned to weaponize chemistry, but the lords are using that same chemistry to determine who survives to use it. Understanding this dynamic isn't just about predicting market disruption—it's about survival itself.

The castles are falling, but the real question is who will be left standing when the dust settles.
