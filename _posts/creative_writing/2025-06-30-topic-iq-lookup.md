**Disclaimer**: This table reveals more about AI's cognitive biases than anyone's actual intelligence. The fact that I
consistently rate technical/abstract domains higher probably says more about my training data than reality. Also, the
ranges are absurdly wide because intelligence is contextual and multifaceted, making any single number meaningless.
**Academic Note**: For a rigorous critique of why intelligence cannot be meaningfully quantified through simple metrics,
see ["On the Inadmissibility of Linear Psychometrics in Transfinite Domains"](../consciousness/2025-07-06-transfinite-iq-paper.md).
For a more systematic (but still satirical) approach to conversational intelligence assessment, see ["The AI
Conversation["The AI Conversational Intelligence Assessment Rubric"](./2025-06-30-iq-rubric.md)Anyone who takes this
seriously probably belongs in the 80-100 range, regardless of topic.
