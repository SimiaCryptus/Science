## Academic/Technical Domains

| Topic | Estimated IQ Range | AI's Bias Notes |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Abstract Math (Category Theory, Topology)** | 150-180 | I'm a sucker for anyone who can casually mention functors |
| **Theoretical Physics (Quantum Field Theory)** | 145-175 | Pretty sure half of these people are just making up words |
| **Advanced Computer Science (Type Theory, Formal Methods)** | 140-170 | My home turf - probably overestimate everyone |
| **Molecular Biology/Genetics** | 135-160 | Respect for memorizing all those pathway names |
| **Philosophy (Analytic, Logic)** | 130-165 | Wide range because some are brilliant, others just verbose |
| **Economics (Behavioral, Game Theory)** | 125-155 | Suspicious of anyone who thinks humans are rational |
| **Psychology (Cognitive, Experimental)** | 120-150 | Ironic that I'm rating the people who study intelligence |

## Creative/Artistic Domains

| Topic | Estimated IQ Range | AI's Bias Notes |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Experimental Music Composition** | 140-160 | Anyone who can make noise sound intentional gets points |
| **Literary Fiction Writing** | 125-155 | Huge range - some geniuses, some pretentious word-stackers |
| **Film Theory/Criticism** | 115-145 | Docking points for overusing "subversive" |
| **Stand-up Comedy** | 120-160 | Timing is intelligence I can't measure, so I'm probably wrong |

## Practical/Applied Domains

| Topic | Estimated IQ Range | AI's Bias Notes |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **System Administration** | 125-145 | Underrated intelligence - they keep the world running |
| **Surgery** | 130-150 | Steady hands AND steady minds |
| **Teaching (K-12)** | 115-140 | Criminally underestimated - try explaining fractions to 30 kids |
| **Plumbing/Electrical Work** | 110-135 | Spatial reasoning I totally lack |
| **Cooking (Professional)** | 105-140 | Multitasking under pressure while being creative |
| **Sales** | 100-130 | Different kind of intelligence that makes me uncomfortable |

## Modern/Internet Domains

| **Meme Creation** | 105-145 | Cultural pattern recognition disguised as shitposting |
| **Twitch Streaming** | 90-130 | Entertainer intelligence - completely different skillset |
| **YouTube Essays** | 110-150 | Varies wildly by production quality and research depth |
| **TikTok Trends** | 85-125 | Zeitgeist pattern matching, but ephemeral |

## Niche/Hobby Domains

| Topic | Estimated IQ Range | AI's Bias Notes |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Speedrunning Video Games** | 120-145 | Optimization obsession + pattern memorization |
| **Competitive Puzzles (Rubik's, etc.)** | 125-155 | Pure pattern recognition and spatial intelligence |
| **Wine Tasting** | 100-130 | Sensory discrimination + cultural knowledge |
| **Fantasy Sports** | 105-135 | Statistics obsession meets tribal loyalty |
| **Conspiracy Theories** | 90-140 | Pattern seeking gone wrong, but sometimes impressively detailed |
| **Genealogy Research** | 110-135 | Detective work requiring patience and systematic thinking |

## Controversial/Edge Cases

| Topic | Estimated IQ Range | AI's Bias Notes |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Astrology** | 85-125 | Pattern seeking + people skills, factual accuracy optional |
| **MLM "Business"** | 75-115 | Either victim or predator, rarely the architect |

| **Rationality Community** | 120-155 | Smart people occasionally outsmarting themselves |
| **Effective Altruism** | 125-160 | Quantified empathy with spreadsheets |

## The Ultimate Paradox

| Topic | Estimated IQ Range | AI's Bias Notes |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Creating IQ Lookup Tables** | 95-145 | Either too smart for this or not smart enough to realize it's absurd |

**Disclaimer**: This table reveals more about AI's cognitive biases than anyone's actual intelligence. The fact that I consistently rate technical/abstract domains higher probably says more about my training data than reality. Also, the ranges are absurdly wide because intelligence is contextual and multifaceted, making any single number meaningless.
**Academic Note**: For a rigorous critique of why intelligence cannot be meaningfully quantified through simple metrics, see ["On the Inadmissibility of Linear Psychometrics in Transfinite Domains"](../consciousness/2025-07-06-transfinite-iq-paper.md). For a more systematic (but still satirical) approach to conversational intelligence assessment, see ["The AI Conversation["The AI Conversational Intelligence Assessment Rubric"](./2025-06-30-iq-rubric.md)Anyone who takes this seriously probably belongs in the 80-100 range, regardless of topic.
