# Kinematic Voxel Carving: A Framework for Procedural Mechanism Synthesis

## 1. Abstract

This document outlines a computational framework for generating 3D mechanical linkages—specifically gears and kinematic
couplings—using **Voxel-Based Topology Optimization**. Unlike traditional CAD methods that rely on analytical geometry (
e.g., involute curves), this system "discovers" optimal mechanical shapes by simulating the kinematic constraints of
rotating or moving bodies within a discretized voxel grid.

By defining the motion paths and bounding volumes of two or more bodies, the system iteratively solves for a
configuration where bodies maximize their volume without violating spatial constraints. This approach enables the
creation of non-standard gears, print-in-place locking mechanisms, and complex organic linkages that are mathematically
difficult to describe but physically functional.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

The central thesis of this engine is **Kinematic Subtraction over Time** combined with **Cellular Automata (CA)
Smoothing**.

1. **Implicit Definition:** We do not draw teeth. We define *motion* and *volume*. The teeth are the emergent result of
   these definitions.
2. **Resolution Agnostic:** The physics are solved at a coarse level first. High-fidelity details are only calculated
   where necessary (at the interface surfaces).
3. **Structural Emergence:** Connectivity and structural integrity are enforced via local neighbor rules (CA),
   preventing "floating islands" of geometry.

---

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1. The Body Definition

A "Body" is a container for a voxel grid and its kinematic properties.

* **Extent (Bounding Volume):** The maximum possible shape of the object (e.g., a cylinder, a cone, a torus, or an
  arbitrary mesh).
* **Kinematic Frame:** A function $T(t)$ that returns a $4\times4$ transformation matrix (Rotation + Translation) for
  any given time $t$.
* **Symmetry Constraints:** Rules defining required repetition (e.g., "Radial Symmetry: 8" implies that if voxel $V$
  exists, $V_{rotated}$ must also exist).

### 3.2. The Voxel Grid

Instead of a Cartesian grid or Octree, the system utilizes a **Cylindrical Voxel Grid** optimized for rotational bodies.

* **Geometry:** Voxels are defined in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta, z)$. Each voxel is a "slice of cake" (a
  frustum of a sector) defined by a range for radius $r$, angle $\theta$, and height $z$.
* **State:** Each voxel holds a state: `SOLID`, `EMPTY`, or `UNKNOWN` (during solving).
* **Metadata:** Each voxel may store `FitnessScore` or `ConstraintViolationCount`.

---

## 4. The Solver Engine

The solver operates in a loop of **Constraint Application** and **Volume Optimization**.

### 4.1. The Constraint Matrix

The fundamental rule is: *Two bodies cannot occupy the same point in World Space at the same time $t$.*

Let $V_A$ be a voxel in Body A and $V_B$ be a voxel in Body B.
For a full rotation cycle $t \in [0, 360^\circ]$:

1. Transform $V_A$ to World Space: $P_{world} = T_A(t) \cdot V_A$.
2. Transform $P_{world}$ into Body B's local space: $P_B = T_B(t)^{-1} \cdot P_{world}$.
3. If $P_B$ lands inside a voxel coordinate currently marked `SOLID` in Body B, a **Constraint Violation** is recorded.

### 4.2. Optimization Strategy (Maximally-Filled)

We do not simply subtract B from A. We want *both* to be as large as possible to ensure strength.

* **Heuristic:** If a collision occurs, which voxel do we delete?
* **The "Center of Mass" Bias:** Voxels closer to the kinematic axis of their respective body are weighted higher. We
  prefer to delete voxels at the periphery (teeth tips) rather than the core (hub).
* **Symmetry Enforcement:** If we delete voxel $V$, we must immediately delete all its symmetric counterparts to
  maintain balance.

### 4.3. Handling Locking and Interference

* **Standard Gears:** The solver removes all collisions, resulting in smooth running.
* **Locking Mechanisms:** If the user desires a lock (e.g., a ratchet), the kinematic definition includes a "Stop"
  phase. The solver will carve geometry that permits rotation up to a point, then physically collides (locks) because no
  valid subtraction exists to allow further movement without destroying the core volume.

---

## 5. Iterative Resolution & Refinement

To make this computationally feasible, we use a **Multigrid Approach**.

### Phase 1: Coarse Solve

* **Grid Size:** Low (e.g., $32^3$ voxels).
* **Action:** Solve the kinematic constraints.
* **Result:** Blocky, Minecraft-like gears that roughly mesh.

### Phase 2: Boundary Detection

* Identify **Surface Voxels**: Any `SOLID` voxel adjacent to an `EMPTY` voxel.
* Identify **Interaction Zones**: Any voxel in Body A that comes within distance $D$ of Body B during the rotation
  cycle.
* **Optimization:** We *only* care about these zones. The internal volume of the gear is static.

### Phase 3: Sub-division (Refinement)

* Subdivide the Surface Voxels into $2 \times 2 \times 2$ smaller voxels.
* Re-run the Constraint Solver *only* on these new smaller voxels.
* Repeat this process until the desired physical resolution (e.g., 0.1mm for 3D printing) is reached.

---

## 6. Cellular Automata (CA) & Structural Integrity

Raw kinematic subtraction often leaves "floating islands" (debris) or impossibly thin connections. We solve this using *
*Voxel Neighborhood Fitness Functions** akin to Cellular Automata rules.

**The "Life" Rules for Mechanical Voxels:**
After every constraint pass, run a CA simulation:

1. **The Island Rule:** If a voxel has 0 neighbors, it dies (becomes `EMPTY`).
2. **The Strut Rule:** If a voxel has only 1 neighbor, it is structurally weak. It either dies (pruning) or triggers a "
   growth" event to connect to a nearby solid (reinforcement), depending on user settings.
3. **The Smoothing Rule:** If an `EMPTY` voxel is surrounded by $\ge 6$ `SOLID` neighbors, it becomes `SOLID` (filling
   internal voids).
4. **The Axis Anchor:** Voxels touching the central rotation axis are immutable (infinite fitness). Connectivity is
   traced from the axis outward. Any voxel not connected to the axis via a chain of neighbors is culled.

---

## 7. Potential Applications

This engine allows for the generation of mechanisms that are difficult to design in CAD:

1. **Non-Parallel Axis Gears:**
    * Simply define Axis A as vertical and Axis B as tilted $45^\circ$. The solver will naturally carve **Hypoid** or *
      *Bevel** geometries without the user needing to know the complex math.
2. **Variable Ratio Gears:**
    * Define the rotation speed of Body A as constant, and Body B as a sine wave. The system will generate *
      *Non-Circular Gears** (elliptical/nautilus gears).
3. **Print-in-Place Assemblies:**
    * Define a "gap tolerance" (e.g., 2 voxels). The solver ensures that even at the tightest mesh point, there is a
      physical gap, allowing the mechanism to be printed pre-assembled and fused, then broken free.
4. **Internal/Cavity Gears:**
    * Body A is a sphere, Body B is a star shape inside it. The system generates a 3D internal track mechanism.

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

### Step 1: The Data Structure

* Implement a cylindrical voxel grid class.
* Implement basic geometric primitives (Cylinder, Cube) to populate the grid.

### Step 2: The Kinematic Loop

* Implement the "Time Step" loop.
* Implement Matrix transformations for voxels.
* Create a visualizer (Point cloud or basic mesh) to debug the "Swept Volume."

### Step 3: The Constraint Solver (Coarse)

* Implement the collision detection logic.
* Implement the "Delete" logic (Boolean subtraction).
* Implement Symmetry mirroring.

### Step 4: The CA Post-Processor

* Implement the "Flood Fill" algorithm to detect disconnected islands.
* Implement the neighbor-count pruning rules.

### Step 5: Refinement & Meshing

* Implement the Cylindrical subdivision for boundary voxels (splitting $r, \theta, z$).
* Implement **Dual Contouring** or **Marching Cubes** to convert the final voxel state into an STL/OBJ file.
* Add Laplacian Smoothing to the final mesh to remove "voxel stepping" artifacts.

## 9. Conclusion

This document describes a generative design engine that trades analytical precision for simulation-based robustness. By
treating mechanical design as a space-time constraint problem, we can automate the creation of complex, functional, and
novel mechanisms ready for digital fabrication.
