# The Trilingual Nightmare: A Day in Ancient Alexandria

*The Journal of Khenti, High Priest of Thoth, in the 23rd Year of Emperor Antoninus Pius*

---

## Dawn: The Sacred Awakening

I rise before Ra touches the horizon, as is proper. First duty: the morning calculations for temple offerings. Sacred
mathematics require hieratic numerals - the flowing script that connects us to Ma'at's eternal order. Twenty loaves,
thirty measures of beer, forty-two sacred oils (for the forty-two judges of the dead, naturally).

But my stylus pauses. Yesterday's Roman grain shipment was recorded as "XLII sacks." My assistant Djedkhonsuiuefankh (I
must remember to suggest he consider a shorter name) has dutifully copied this as 𓎉𓎉𓎉𓎉𓈇𓈇 in our ledger. Forty-two in our
beautiful hieratic. But now I must verify: does Roman "XLII" truly equal our forty-two, or have I misunderstood their
backwards-counting system again?

*[Khenti draws lines in the sand: I, II, III, IV, V... counts on fingers... yes, forty-two. Praise Thoth.]*

## Morning: The Bureaucratic Hydra

Knock at the temple door. A Roman courier with official scroll: "Census report required in Latin numerals by Ides of
Martius." I stare at the wax tablet. We have MCDXVII temple visitors this month. But how do I convert our visitor tally
marks into... whatever this Roman madness demands?

I count our vertical strokes (||||||||||||...) and realize I need to think backwards. One thousand (M), plus four
hundred (CD - why subtract C from D instead of writing CCCC? Romans!), plus ten (X), plus five (V), plus two (II).
MCDXVII.

Wait. No. That's one thousand four hundred seventeen. But we had one thousand seven hundred forty-three visitors. Let me
try again...

*[Twenty minutes later, covered in ink stains and sand dust]*

MDCCXLIII. Finally. My scribe Djedkhonsuiuefankh watches with barely concealed pity. "Master," he ventures, "perhaps we
should hire a Roman clerk for these translations?"

"Never," I snap. "Thoth's priests do not surrender the sacred mathematics to barbarians who can't decide whether V comes
before or after I."

## Midday: The Merchant's Dilemma

Apollodorus arrives with his donation ledger. Blessed fellow wants to give silver to repair the sanctuary roof. But his
accounts are in those Hindu-Arab numerals the eastern traders use: "247 drachmae."

I stare at the marks: 2, 4, 7. Each symbol means something absolute - not like Roman letters that change meaning based
on position. This "2" means two, always. This "4" means four, not "one less than five." Revolutionary concept. Almost...
logical?

But how do I record this in our temple books? Do I translate to hieratic (𓏤𓏤𓎆𓎆𓎆𓎆𓐍) or Roman (CCXLVII) or keep the
original? Each choice carries implications. Hieratic honors the gods, Roman satisfies the prefect, Hindu-Arab reflects
economic reality.

I compromise: all three, in parallel columns. My scrolls look like a madman's fever dream, but at least everyone can
read something.

## Afternoon: The Translation Crisis

Emergency! A grain shortage dispute between Egyptian farmers, Roman tax collectors, and Greek merchants. Each party has
documented the same shipments in different systems:

**Egyptian farmers (hieratic):** "We delivered 𓍧𓎆𓎆𓎆 sacks" (1,300)
**Roman tax collectors (Latin):** "We received MCC sacks" (1,200)  
**Greek merchants (alphabetic numerals):** "We sold ΑΤ´ sacks" (1,301)

Three counting systems, three different totals, one very angry Roman prefect demanding to know who's lying.

I spread my papyrus on the floor, surrounded by counting stones, tally marks, and increasingly frantic calculations.
Djedkhonsuiuefankh brings beer. We count everything three times in three different systems.

The truth emerges: everyone is correct within their own system, but they're counting different things. Egyptians count
full sacks, Romans count official weight units, Greeks count transaction records. Same grain, different mathematical
universes.

## Evening: The Philosophical Crisis

As Ra descends, I contemplate the day's chaos. Three empires, three ways of understanding quantity, three assumptions
about what numbers mean.

Our hieratic numerals embed cosmic order - they connect to Ma'at's eternal balance. Roman numerals declare imperial
authority - they organize the world into legions and provinces. Hindu-Arab numerals serve pure function - they calculate
without ceremony.

But which system reveals truth? When I count temple offerings, am I discovering divine mathematics (Egyptian), imposing
human order (Roman), or simply processing data (Arab)?

Young Djedkhonsuiuefankh finds me staring at three versions of the same calculation. "Master, does it matter which
symbols we use if the grain is the same grain?"

Wise boy. But he doesn't understand: symbols shape thought. Count in Roman numerals, think like a Roman administrator.
Count in hieratic, commune with eternal principles. Count in Hindu-Arab numerals, and numbers become tools divorced from
meaning.

## Night: The Dream of Simplicity

I dream of Imhotep's time, when Egyptian priests used one script, served one pharaoh, calculated one truth. We measured
the Nile's flood in cubits, counted temple offerings in sacred tens, aligned pyramids to eternal stars. Mathematics was
worship, numbers were prayer.

Now I wake to trilingual accounting, multicultural taxation, and the exhausting necessity of thinking simultaneously
like an Egyptian mystic, Roman bureaucrat, and Arab merchant.

Tomorrow: the Roman prefect wants quarterly reports. The Greek merchants need conversion tables. The Arab traders
require calculations in their strange but efficient numerals.

And somewhere in this babel of symbols, the gods still demand their proper offerings, counted in the sacred mathematics
that predate all empires.

*[Final entry, written in all three scripts simultaneously]*

**Hieratic:** 𓂋𓈖 𓍯𓄿 𓎛𓂋𓏤 𓁹 𓊃𓊪𓊗 (Ra grant me strength)

**Latin:** THOTH MAGNE AUXILIA (Great Thoth, help me)

**Greek numerals:** The symbols are too foreign; I'll stick to prayers in civilized scripts

## The Next Day: Divine Intervention from the Marketplace

Walking home yesterday through the merchant quarter (still muttering about Roman numerals), I noticed a peculiar
clicking sound from a Syrian trader's stall. Curious, I approached.

"What is that wooden contraption?" I asked.

The trader, gap-toothed but clever-eyed, grinned. "Abacus, priest. Chinese invention, but we Syrians improved it.
Watch." He began sliding colored beads along parallel rods with startling speed. "I can count in any man's numbers -
Roman, Egyptian, Greek, Hindu, Babylonian - doesn't matter. The beads tell truth."

Intrigued despite myself, I watched him demonstrate. "Show me XLII Roman sacks," I requested.

Click-click-slide - he arranged beads in precise patterns. "Now read it in your Egyptian marks," he said.

I stared at the configuration: four tens, two ones. Our hieratic 𓎉𓎉𓎉𓎉𓈇𓈇. Exactly right.

"And in those Hindu-Arab symbols?"

"Forty-two," he said, pointing to the same bead arrangement. "4 and 2. Same number, priest. Different words for same
truth."

By Thoth's wisdom, I purchased it immediately.

## That Same Evening: The Revolution

Djedkhonsuiuefankh found me in my chamber at midnight, surrounded by papyrus and clicking furiously on my new device.

"Master? You seem... different."

"Different? My boy, I am LIBERATED!" I gestured wildly at the abacus. "Watch this miracle: Roman tax assessment -
MCDXVII temple visitors." Click-slide-click. "Egyptian temple record - 𓆼𓍢𓎆𓐍𓐍𓐍 same visitors!" More clicking. "Hindu-Arab
merchant calculation - 1417 identical visitors!"

I was practically dancing around the chamber. "Don't you see? The Romans aren't using different numbers - they're using
different WORDS for the same numbers! This wooden marvel doesn't lie, doesn't politic, doesn't care about imperial
dignity or sacred tradition. It just... counts!"

Djedkhonsuiuefankh looked concerned. "Master, you seem almost... happy?"

## The Next Morning: Practical Divinity

Dawn brought the usual chaos, but now I was armed. Roman courier? Click-click, I convert our hieratic temple records to
his Latin numerals instantly. Greek merchant? Slide-slide, I translate his alphabetic numbers to ours without breaking
sweat.

The grain shortage dispute that tormented me yesterday? I lined up representatives from all three parties, set the
abacus between us like a judge's bench. "Each of you, show me your count using these beads."

Egyptian farmer: slides beads to show his 1,300 sacks
Roman tax collector: confused initially, then arranges the same beads to represent his "MCC"
Greek merchant: manipulates beads for his ΑΤ´

"Observe," I announced dramatically, "you all counted the same amount. Your dispute is not about grain - it's about
definitions. Farmer counts full sacks, tax collector counts official weight units, merchant counts transaction records."

The room fell silent. The Syrian trader, who had come to collect payment, nodded approvingly. "Priest learns quickly.
Numbers are numbers. Only the words change."

## Midday: The Philosophical Breakthrough

As I calculated temple offerings (click-slide-click), a profound realization struck me. This wooden device embodies
Ma'at's eternal principle of truth more perfectly than our most sacred hieroglyphs.

Egyptian numerals connect us to divine order - but they can obscure practical truth with ceremonial meaning. Roman
numerals assert imperial authority - but they make calculation needlessly complex. Hindu-Arab numerals serve pure
function - but they lack spiritual resonance.

The abacus transcends all these limitations. It reveals mathematical truth in any language, serves any empire's needs,
adapts to any merchant's requirements. It is, in essence, the perfect priestly tool: respectful of all traditions while
enslaved to none.

Djedkhonsuiuefankh watches me work with something approaching awe. "Master, you've solved trilingual accounting."

"More than that, my boy. I've discovered that Thoth's wisdom includes knowing when to embrace foreign inventions that
serve eternal truth."

## Evening: The Convert

That Syrian trader returned as I was closing the temple. "How fares the counting machine, priest?"

"It has revolutionized my existence," I declared. "But I have questions. Can you teach me more advanced techniques?"

He laughed. "Priest, you've used it one day and already you calculate faster than clerks who've trained for years. But
yes - Chinese masters know methods for multiplication, division, even square roots. All on beads."

"Square roots on beads?" My mind reeled. "Can you... can you obtain instructional scrolls?"

"For the right price." He grinned that gap-toothed grin. "But I warn you - once you truly master this device, you may
never want to return to scratching numbers in sand."

I looked at my chamber: papyrus covered with crossed-out calculations, ink stains on my robes, three different styluses
for three different scripts.

Then I looked at the abacus: clean, efficient, honest.

"I don't think that will be a problem."

it twenty. Some innovations serve all traditions at once."*
