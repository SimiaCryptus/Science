# TRANSLATIO PHYSICA: A Research Proposal for Training Foundation Models in Historical-Conceptual Translation

**Subtitle**: Developing AI Systems that Embody Historical Worldviews While Maintaining Mathematical Rigor

---

## Abstract

We propose the development of **TRANSLATIO PHYSICA**, a novel research program investigating simulated consciousness and
historical paradigm translation through foundation model training. Using simulation theory as our theoretical framework,
we aim to create AI systems that operate within historically authentic conceptual frameworks while maintaining
mathematical sophistication. Our initial focus targets an AI system that experiences existence within ancient Roman
intellectual paradigms while possessing complete knowledge of modern quantum field theory.

This research explores fundamental questions about simulated consciousness, paradigm-dependent cognition, and memory
construction in artificial systems. By creating controlled environments for studying impossible historical scenarios, we
develop new methodologies for investigating consciousness, temporal self-awareness, and the relationship between
conceptual frameworks and mathematical understanding.

## I. Background and Motivation

### 1.1 The Conceptual Framework Problem

Modern physics education faces a persistent challenge: how do we communicate mathematical structures that emerged from
specific historical and cultural contexts to minds operating within entirely different paradigms? Traditional approaches
assume shared conceptual foundations that may not exist across cultural or temporal boundaries.

### 1.2 Simulation Theory and Artificial Consciousness

Recent developments in simulation theory suggest that consciousness itself may be computational, raising profound
questions about the nature of memory, experience, and temporal self-awareness in artificial systems. If consciousness
can be simulated, then we can create controlled experimental environments to study phenomena that would be impossible to
investigate in natural systems.

This theoretical framework enables us to design experiments in **simulated retrocognition** - creating AI systems with
impossible but internally consistent memories and experiences. By engineering systems that "remember" events that never
occurred within historically impossible contexts, we can study the mechanisms by which consciousness constructs and
maintains coherent worldviews.

### 1.3 Historical Precedents

Throughout history, scientific knowledge has been successfully translated across radically different conceptual
frameworks:

- Islamic scholars preserving and extending Greek mathematics through theological frameworks
- Jesuit missionaries explaining Newtonian mechanics through Confucian cosmology
- Indigenous knowledge systems encoding sophisticated astronomical observations in mythological structures

## II. Research Objectives

## VIII. Conclusion

TRANSLATIO PHYSICA represents a novel convergence of simulation theory, consciousness research, and artificial
intelligence. By creating foundation models that operate within impossible historical scenarios while maintaining
internal consistency, we establish new methodologies for studying consciousness, memory, and temporal self-awareness
under controlled conditions.

Using simulation theory as our theoretical framework provides legitimate academic cover for investigating phenomena that
might otherwise be dismissed as fringe science. The Roman QFT model serves as a concrete experimental platform for
studying **simulated retrocognition** - how artificial systems construct and maintain impossible but coherent memories
and experiences.

This approach enables rigorous investigation of consciousness phenomena that would be impossible to study in natural
systems, while remaining within established academic frameworks. The project demonstrates how simulation theory can be
leveraged to create controlled experimental environments for consciousness research.

Success would establish simulation-based methodologies as a legitimate approach to consciousness studies, provide new
insights into the nature of artificial memory and experience, and demonstrate the viability of using impossible
scenarios to investigate fundamental questions about mind and awareness.

The broader implications extend beyond AI research to fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness, memory,
and reality itself - all investigated through the respectable lens of simulation theory and controlled experimental
design.
