# Enhanced CEP-RLE: Multi-Orientation Scanning and Wavelet-Based Geometric Analysis

## Mathematical Framework for Advanced CEP-RLE Extensions

### 1. Multi-Orientation Ensemble Scanning

#### 1.1 Orientation Space Definition

Let **Θ** = {θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ} be a set of scanning orientations where θᵢ ∈ [0, 2π).

For each orientation θᵢ, define the scanning line transformation:
```
L_θᵢ(t, s) = p₀ + t·û_θᵢ + s·v̂_θᵢ
```
where:
- **p₀** ∈ ℝ² is the scanning origin
- **û_θᵢ** = (cos θᵢ, sin θᵢ) is the scanning direction unit vector
- **v̂_θᵢ** = (-sin θᵢ, cos θᵢ) is the perpendicular direction unit vector
- **t** ∈ ℝ is the parameter along the scanning line
- **s** ∈ ℝ is the offset between parallel scanning lines

#### 1.2 Multi-Orientation Run Extraction

For each orientation θᵢ, extract continuous runs:
```
R^(θᵢ) = {r^(θᵢ)_j,k | j = 1,...,m_θᵢ, k = 1,...,n^(θᵢ)_j}
```
where:
- **r^(θᵢ)_j,k** = (t^(θᵢ)_start, t^(θᵢ)_end, v^(θᵢ)_j, c_k) represents the k-th run on the j-th scanning line
- **t^(θᵢ)_start, t^(θᵢ)_end** ∈ ℝ are the continuous start and end positions
- **v^(θᵢ)_j** is the perpendicular offset of the j-th scanning line
- **c_k** is the semantic content (color/value)

#### 1.3 Ensemble Geometric Reconstruction

For a geometric feature **F**, its ensemble representation is:
```
F_ensemble = {F^(θ₁), F^(θ₂), ..., F^(θₙ)}
```

**Ensemble Boundary Estimation:**
For a point **p** on the boundary, collect all intersection measurements:
```
I(p) = {(θᵢ, t^(θᵢ)_intersect) | p ∈ L_θᵢ(t^(θᵢ)_intersect, s_j)}
```

**Robust Boundary Reconstruction:**
Use weighted least squares to estimate boundary position:
```
p̂ = argmin_p Σᵢ wᵢ ||p - (p₀ + t^(θᵢ)_intersect·û_θᵢ + s_j·v̂_θᵢ)||²
```
where **wᵢ** are confidence weights based on measurement quality.

### 2. Island Run Topology and Evolution

#### 2.1 Island Run Definition

An **island run** **I** is a connected component of runs across adjacent scanlines:
```
I = {r_j,k | j ∈ J_I, overlap(r_j,k, r_{j+1,*}) > τ}
```
where:
- **J_I** ⊆ {1, 2, ..., m} is the set of scanline indices containing the island
- **τ > 0** is the minimum overlap threshold for connectivity
- **overlap(r_a, r_b)** measures spatial overlap between runs

#### 2.2 Island Geometric Descriptors

For each island **I**, define:

**Offset Evolution Function:**
```
δ_I(y) = x_center(I, y) - x_center(I, y₀)
```
where **x_center(I, y)** is the centroid x-coordinate of island **I** at scanline **y**.

**Span Evolution Function:**
```
w_I(y) = x_end(I, y) - x_start(I, y)
```
where **x_start(I, y)** and **x_end(I, y)** are the leftmost and rightmost boundaries.

**Island Lifespan:**
```
L_I = [y_birth, y_death] = [min(J_I), max(J_I)]
```

#### 2.3 Island Topology Events

**Birth Event:** Island **I** appears at scanline **y**:
```
Birth(I, y) ⟺ |{r_{y-1,k} : overlap(r_{y,*}, r_{y-1,k}) > τ}| = 0
```

**Death Event:** Island **I** disappears after scanline **y**:
```
Death(I, y) ⟺ |{r_{y+1,k} : overlap(r_{y,*}, r_{y+1,k}) > τ}| = 0
```

**Split Event:** Island **I** splits into islands **I₁, I₂** at scanline **y**:
```
Split(I → I₁, I₂, y) ⟺ Connected(I, y-1) ∧ ¬Connected(I₁ ∪ I₂, y)
```

**Merge Event:** Islands **I₁, I₂** merge into island **I** at scanline **y**:
```
Merge(I₁, I₂ → I, y) ⟺ ¬Connected(I₁ ∪ I₂, y-1) ∧ Connected(I, y)
```

### 3. Wavelet Analysis of Geometric Profiles

#### 3.1 Wavelet Transform of Island Profiles

For an island **I** with lifespan **L_I = [y₁, y₂]**, define the profile functions:

**Discrete Profile Sampling:**
```
δ̃_I = {δ_I(y₁), δ_I(y₁+1), ..., δ_I(y₂)} ∈ ℝ^{|L_I|}
w̃_I = {w_I(y₁), w_I(y₁+1), ..., w_I(y₂)} ∈ ℝ^{|L_I|}
```

**Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT):**
```
W_δ(a, b) = (1/√a) ∫ δ_I(y) ψ*((y-b)/a) dy
W_w(a, b) = (1/√a) ∫ w_I(y) ψ*((y-b)/a) dy
```
where:
- **ψ(y)** is the mother wavelet function
- **a > 0** is the scale parameter
- **b ∈ ℝ** is the translation parameter
- **ψ*** is the complex conjugate of **ψ**

#### 3.2 Multi-Scale Geometric Descriptors

**Scale-Space Feature Vector:**
```
F_I = [F_I^{(1)}, F_I^{(2)}, ..., F_I^{(J)}]
```
where **F_I^{(j)}** represents features at scale level **j**.

**Scale-Specific Features:**
```
F_I^{(j)} = [||W_δ^{(j)}||₂, ||W_w^{(j)}||₂, E_δ^{(j)}, E_w^{(j)}, H_δ^{(j)}, H_w^{(j)}]
```
where:
- **||W^{(j)}||₂** is the L² norm of wavelet coefficients at scale **j**
- **E^{(j)} = Σ_b |W(a_j, b)|²** is the energy at scale **j**
- **H^{(j)} = -Σ_b p_b log p_b** is the entropy where **p_b = |W(a_j, b)|²/E^{(j)}**

#### 3.3 Wavelet-Based Shape Classification

**Shape Signature Matrix:**
```
S_I = [W_δ(a₁, b₁) ... W_δ(a₁, b_B)]
      [    ⋮      ⋱      ⋮    ]
      [W_δ(a_A, b₁) ... W_δ(a_A, b_B)]
```

**Invariant Geometric Descriptors:**

*Translation Invariance:* Use relative wavelet coefficients:
```
W̃_δ(a, b) = W_δ(a, b) - W_δ(a, b₀)
```

*Scale Invariance:* Normalize by island span:
```
Ŵ_δ(a, b) = W_δ(a, b) / max_y w_I(y)
```

*Rotation Invariance:* For multi-orientation ensemble:
```
W_ensemble(a, b) = (1/N) Σᵢ W^{(θᵢ)}_δ(a, b)
```

### 4. Enhanced Expectation-Prior Mechanism

#### 4.1 Multi-Orientation Statistical Models

For each spatial bin **B_k** and orientation **θᵢ**, maintain statistical models:

**Profile Expectation Models:**
```
μ_δ^{(θᵢ)}(B_k) = E[δ_I(y) | I ∈ B_k, θᵢ]
Σ_δ^{(θᵢ)}(B_k) = Cov[δ_I(y) | I ∈ B_k, θᵢ]
```

**Wavelet Coefficient Models:**
```
μ_W^{(θᵢ)}(a_j, B_k) = E[W_δ(a_j, ·) | I ∈ B_k, θᵢ]
Σ_W^{(θᵢ)}(a_j, B_k) = Cov[W_δ(a_j, ·) | I ∈ B_k, θᵢ]
```

#### 4.2 Ensemble Prediction

**Orientation-Weighted Prediction:**
```
P(δ_I(y+1) | H_y) = Σᵢ w_θᵢ P^{(θᵢ)}(δ_I(y+1) | H_y^{(θᵢ)})
```
where **w_θᵢ** are orientation confidence weights and **H_y^{(θᵢ)}** is the history for orientation **θᵢ**.

**Wavelet-Informed Prediction:**
```
P(I_{y+1} | I_y, W_I) ∝ exp(-||W_I - μ_W(B_k)||²_{Σ_W(B_k)})
```

### 5. Computational Complexity Analysis

#### 5.1 Multi-Orientation Scanning Complexity

**Time Complexity:**
- **Single orientation:** O(HW) for H×W image
- **N orientations:** O(NHW) for scanning
- **Ensemble reconstruction:** O(N²HW) for all pairwise correlations

**Space Complexity:**
- **Run storage:** O(NR) where R is average number of runs per orientation
- **Ensemble data:** O(N²F) where F is number of features

#### 5.2 Wavelet Analysis Complexity

**Per Island Analysis:**
- **CWT computation:** O(L log L) where L is island lifespan
- **Multi-scale features:** O(JL) where J is number of scales
- **Total for I islands:** O(I·J·L̄ log L̄) where L̄ is average lifespan

#### 5.3 Overall Algorithm Complexity

**Enhanced CEP-RLE Total Complexity:**
```
T_total = O(NHW + I·J·L̄ log L̄ + N²R)
```

**Memory Requirements:**
```
M_total = O(NR + I·J·L̄ + N²F)
```

### 6. Implementation Considerations

#### 6.1 Orientation Selection Strategies

**Uniform Sampling:**
```
Θ_uniform = {2πk/N | k = 0, 1, ..., N-1}
```

**Adaptive Sampling:**
```
Θ_adaptive = argmin_Θ Σᵢ H(F^{(θᵢ)}) subject to |Θ| ≤ N_max
```
where H(F^{(θᵢ)}) is the entropy of features extracted at orientation θᵢ.

**Hierarchical Sampling:**
```
Θ₁ = {0, π/2}  (coarse)
Θ₂ = Θ₁ ∪ {π/4, 3π/4}  (medium)
Θ₃ = Θ₂ ∪ {π/8, 3π/8, 5π/8, 7π/8}  (fine)
```

#### 6.2 Wavelet Basis Selection

**Shape-Specific Wavelets:**
- **Geometric shapes:** Gaussian derivatives for smooth boundaries
- **Texture analysis:** Gabor wavelets for periodic patterns
- **Edge detection:** Mexican hat wavelets for discontinuities

**Adaptive Basis Selection:**
```
ψ_optimal = argmin_ψ ∫ |f(y) - f_reconstructed^{(ψ)}(y)|² dy
```

This mathematical framework provides the foundation for implementing multi-orientation scanning with wavelet-based geometric analysis, creating a comprehensive system for shape-aware spatial data compression and analysis.
