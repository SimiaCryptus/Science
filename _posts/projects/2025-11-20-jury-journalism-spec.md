# Jury Journalism Platform - Product Specification

## Core Concept

A democratic journalism platform that treats readers as jury members, optimizing for relevance and decision uncertainty
rather than clicks and confirmation bias. Stories are presented as cases requiring verdicts, with readers actively
participating in evidence evaluation and collaborative investigation.

## Foundational Principles

### The Dual Objective Function

- **Relevance Maximization**: Stories must matter to the reader's jurisdiction (geographic, economic, demographic,
  temporal)
- **Entropy Maximization**: Prioritize stories where readers are genuinely uncertain, avoiding confirmation bias content

### Jurisdictional Framework

- **Geographic Jurisdiction**: Local, state, federal impact zones
- **Economic Jurisdiction**: Industry sectors, market segments, employment categories
- **Demographic Jurisdiction**: Age, education, occupation, values-based groupings
- **Temporal Jurisdiction**: Immediate impact vs. precedent-setting implications

## User Experience Architecture

### Story Structure: The Trial Format

#### Jury Selection Phase

- User profiling to establish jurisdictional relevance
- Pre-story survey: "Based on what you know, what's your initial verdict?"
- Explanation of stakes: "Why this decision matters to you"

#### Opening Statement

- Clear articulation of the decision to be made
- Preview of evidence types to be presented
- Explanation of what constitutes "reasonable doubt" for this case

#### Evidence Presentation

- **Primary Sources First**: Documents, recordings, data presented as exhibits
- **Witness Testimony**: Interviews and statements with credibility assessments
- **Expert Analysis**: Subject matter expertise with conflict-of-interest disclosure
- **Cross-Examination**: Addressing counter-arguments and alternative interpretations

#### Jury Instructions

- Guidance on how to weigh different types of evidence
- Explanation of logical fallacies to avoid
- Standards of proof appropriate to the decision type

#### Deliberation

- Interactive comment system structured as jury deliberation
- Evidence reference tools for debates
- Anonymous verdict tracking with demographic breakdowns

#### Verdict and Appeal

- Reader decision with reasoning requirement
- Comparison with peer verdicts
- "Appeal" option for new evidence submission

### Interactive Participation Features

#### Evidence Contribution System

- **"Consider This Data"**: User-submitted documents, links, and analysis
- **Source Suggestion**: Pointing research agents toward new information streams
- **Local Intelligence**: Insider knowledge and context from domain experts
- **Connection Mapping**: Linking current story to previous investigations

#### Question-Driven Investigation
