# Nuclear Thermal Propulsion System for Asteroid Manipulation

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a novel nuclear thermal propulsion system designed for asteroid deflection and orbital maneuvering applications. The system utilizes subcritical nuclear cores with neutron-initiated thermal reactions, contained within tungsten penetrator jackets, to provide controlled thrust for large-scale asteroid manipulation.

## System Overview

### Core Concept
The system employs deliberately subcritical nuclear masses that achieve controlled thermal reactions through external neutron bombardment. The resulting thermal expansion and material ejection provides propulsive force while maintaining asteroid structural integrity.

### Primary Applications

- **Material**: Highly enriched uranium-235 or plutonium-239
- **Mass**: 15-25 kg subcritical assembly per unit

**Safety Features**
- Core geometry maintains k-effective < 0.85 under all normal conditions
