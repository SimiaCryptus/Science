# Nuclear Thermal Propulsion System for Asteroid Manipulation

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a novel nuclear thermal propulsion system designed for asteroid deflection and orbital
maneuvering applications. The system utilizes subcritical nuclear cores with neutron-initiated thermal reactions,
contained within tungsten penetrator jackets, to provide controlled thrust for large-scale asteroid manipulation.

## System Overview

### Core Concept

The system employs deliberately subcritical nuclear masses that achieve controlled thermal reactions through external
neutron bombardment. The resulting thermal expansion and material ejection provides propulsive force while maintaining
asteroid structural integrity.

### Primary Applications

- **Planetary Defense**: Late-stage asteroid deflection with minimal lead time
- **Mining Operations**: Orbital maneuvering of valuable asteroids to processing facilities
- **Space Debris Management**: Controlled deorbiting of large debris objects
