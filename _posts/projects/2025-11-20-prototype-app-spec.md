# DAG Patch Analyzer - Prototype Application

## Application Overview

A web application that ingests Git commits and auto-regresses them into DAG-based patch representations, with an
interactive interface for exploring the factorization process and resulting operation graph.

## Core Functionality

### Input

- Git repository URL or path
- Commit ID/hash or range
- Optional: GitHub/GitLab PR URL (extracts commit automatically)

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Clone/Fetch** - Retrieve repository and commit data
2. **State Extraction** - Generate before/after tar archives
3. **Auto-Regression** - Factor changes into operation DAG
4. **Analysis** - Compute metrics, detect patterns
5. **Storage** - Persist results for exploration

### Output

- Interactive DAG visualization
- Operation-level breakdown
- Compression metrics
- Analysis insights

## Architecture

### Backend Services

#### Git Ingestion Service

```
Input: repo_url, commit_id
Output: {before_state, after_state, metadata}

- Clone repository (shallow clone for efficiency)
- Checkout commit and parent
- Generate tar archives of both states
- Extract commit metadata (author, message, timestamp, files_changed)
```

#### Factorization Engine

```
Input: {before_state, after_state}
Output: operation_dag

Algorithm phases:
1. Whitespace isolation
2. Rename/move detection (file and symbol level)
3. Copy detection (code duplication)
4. Regex pattern matching (common replacements)
5. Reorder detection (block movements)
6. Binary delta generation (residual)
7. Dependency graph construction
8. Description length optimization
```

#### Analysis Service

```
Input: operation_dag
Output: metrics, patterns, insights

Computes:
- Compression ratio (operations vs raw diff size)
- Operation type distribution
- Dependency depth and parallelism potential
- Pattern matching (known refactoring types)
- Semantic coherence scores
- Change impact radius
```

#### Storage Layer

```
- PostgreSQL for metadata and analysis results
- Object storage (S3/local) for tar archives
- Graph database (Neo4j optional) for DAG queries
- Content-addressed blob store for operations
```

- Nodes: operations (colored by type)
- Edges: dependencies
- Controls: zoom, pan, filter by operation type
- Click node → show details in right panel
- Highlight: critical path, independent subgraphs
- Layout options: topological, hierarchical, force-directed

**Right Panel: Operation Details**

- Selected operation properties
- Before/after code snippets
- Dependency list (upstream/downstream)
- Metrics: size, compression contribution
- Semantic tags (auto-detected)

**Bottom Panel: Global Metrics**

- Total operations count by type
- Compression ratio visualization
- Dependency depth histogram
- Parallelism score

- Trace backward: "what does this depend on?"
- Find critical path (longest dependency chain)
- Identify parallelizable subgraphs
- Collapse/expand operation groups

**Code Context**

- Inline diff view for each operation
- Syntax highlighting
- Jump to file locations
- Show surrounding context

### Pattern Recognition

- Extract method/interface
- Move class/function
- Add error handling pattern
- Update import statements
- Configuration changes
