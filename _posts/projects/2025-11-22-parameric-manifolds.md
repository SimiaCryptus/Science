# Technical Specification: The Parametric Manifold Solver

## 1. Executive Summary

The Parametric Manifold Solver (PMS) is a numerical geometry engine designed to resolve hyperdimensional constraints
into analytical coordinates. Unlike traditional CAD kernels (Parasolid, ACIS) which solve for a single geometric
instance, PMS solves for the **topology of the solution space** (the manifold).

The system is architected to be driven by AI agents via structured, deterministic languages (JSON/TypeScript). It
utilizes a custom numerical solver to minimize constraint error functions in arbitrary dimensions ($N$-D), employing a
space-filling density estimation tree to map the entire cloud of valid geometric configurations.

## 2. Core Philosophy & Architecture

### 2.1. The "Cloud" vs. The "Instance"

Traditional solvers treat degrees of freedom (DOFs) as variables to be fixed immediately. PMS treats DOFs as dimensions
in a probability space.

* **Input:** A set of entities and a set of Euclidean-like constraints.
* **Output:** A discrete representation (cloud/tree) of the valid configuration space where the total constraint
  error $E \approx 0$.

### 2.2. Arbitrary Dimensionality

The engine makes no assumption of $R^2$ or $R^3$.

* A 2D linkage mechanism may be solved in $R^2$.
* A 4-bar linkage optimizing over time may be solved in $R^{2+T}$ (spatial + temporal dimensions).
* A complex hyper-structure may exist in $R^{42}$.

### 2.3. Constructive Resolution

The system uses **Internal Metrics** (relative constraints) to define geometry. Absolute coordinates are derived, not
defined.

* *Anchoring:* To resolve the manifold into Cartesian coordinates, the solver applies minimal priors (e.g., Entity $A$
  is at Origin; Entity $B$ lies on the primary axis) to eliminate rigid body transformations, unless those
  transformations are part of the desired solution set.

## 3. Interface Specification (API)

The API is designed for **LLM Generation**. It favors strict syntax (brackets, types) over whitespace-sensitivity to
ensure parsing reliability.

### 3.1. Language Choice

The primary interface definition is **JSON** (for data interchange) or **TypeScript** (for programmatic definition),
avoiding Python to ensure strict typing and structural clarity.

### 3.2. Schema Definition (TypeScript Syntax)

```typescript
type Scalar = number; // Can be a fixed number or a variable ID
type VectorID = string;

interface Model {
  dimensions: number; // e.g., 2, 3, or N
  variables: {
    [id: string]: { min?: number; max?: number; initial?: number }
  };
  entities: {
    [id: VectorID]: { type: "point" | "vector" | "hyper-sphere" }
  };
  constraints: Constraint[];
  objectives: Objective[];
}

type Constraint =
  | { type: "distance"; a: VectorID; b: VectorID; value: Scalar }
  | { type: "orthogonal"; a: VectorID; b: VectorID }
  | { type: "incidence"; a: VectorID; b: VectorID } // Point on line/plane
  | { type: "symmetry"; a: VectorID; b: VectorID; axis: VectorID };

type Objective =
  | { type: "minimize"; variable: string }
  | { type: "maximize"; variable: string }
  | { type: "target"; variable: string; value: number };
```

### 3.3. Example Payload (JSON)

*A simple triangle where one side length is variable.*

```json
{
  "dimensions": 2,
  "variables": {
    "len_A": { "min": 5.0, "max": 15.0 }
  },
  "entities": {
    "p1": { "type": "point" },
    "p2": { "type": "point" },
    "p3": { "type": "point" }
  },
  "constraints": [
    { "type": "distance", "a": "p1", "b": "p2", "value": 10.0 },
    { "type": "distance", "a": "p2", "b": "p3", "value": 10.0 },
    { "type": "distance", "a": "p3", "b": "p1", "value": "len_A" }
  ]
}
```

## 4. The Numerical Solver Engine

The solver is a custom implementation focusing on **Energy Minimization**. It does not rely on heavy tensor libraries (
like TensorFlow/PyTorch) but implements specific linear algebra routines for performance and portability.

### 4.1. The Energy Function

The system converts all constraints into an error function $E$. For a system state vector $\mathbf{X}$:
$$E(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_{i} w_i \cdot (C_i(\mathbf{X}))^2$$
Where $C_i$ is the residual of constraint $i$ (e.g., $|dist(A,B) - target|$).

### 4.2. Solver Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Random seeding within variable bounds or heuristic placement based on graph topology.
2. **Iterative Descent:**
    * Use **Newton-Raphson** for rapid convergence when close to a solution.
    * Use **Levenberg-Marquardt** (Damped Least Squares) for stability when the system is ill-conditioned.
3. **Anchoring:** The solver automatically fixes the first $N$ degrees of freedom to prevent the system from "floating"
   in hyper-space, unless the user explicitly requests rigid-body exploration.

## 5. Manifold Exploration: The Density Estimation Tree

To generate the "Cloud" of solutions, we reject simple Monte Carlo "surfing" in favor of a deterministic spatial
decomposition method. This ensures we find *all* disconnected clusters of valid solutions.

### 5.1. The Algorithm: Hyper-Octree Decomposition

1. **Bounding Box:** Define the hyper-rectangle of the total parameter space (based on variable min/max).
2. **Subdivision:** Recursively split the space into $2^N$ sub-regions (nodes).
3. **Pruning (Interval Arithmetic):**
    * For each node, calculate the *minimum possible error* within that volume using Interval Arithmetic or Lipschitz
      bounds.
    * If $MinError > \epsilon$, the entire node is invalid. Prune it.
    * If $MinError \le \epsilon$, subdivide further.
4. **Leaf Nodes:** When nodes reach a minimum size, the center points constitute the **Point Cloud** of valid solutions.

### 5.2. Output Analysis

The resulting tree structure allows for immediate topological analysis:

* **Connectivity:** Are all leaf nodes connected neighbors? If not, the solution space has multiple disconnected modes (
  e.g., an elbow joint that can snap 'up' or 'down' but cannot transition between them).
* **Dimensionality:** PCA on the local cloud reveals the effective degrees of freedom at any point.

## 6. Temporal & Trajectory Resolution

To handle "optimization over time" or "range of transformations," the system treats time as a spatial dimension or
parameterizes the path.

### 6.1. Fourier Series Parameterization

Instead of solving for a discrete set of points $P_t$, we solve for the coefficients of a continuous function.
A coordinate $x$ is represented as:
$$x(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{K} (a_n \cos(nt) + b_n \sin(nt))$$

* **The Variables:** The solver optimizes the coefficients $a_n, b_n$.
* **The Constraints:** Constraints are integrated over the domain $t \in [0, 1]$.
    * Example: "Distance between A and B must be constant over time."
    * $\int_0^1 (dist(A(t), B(t)) - L)^2 dt < \epsilon$
* **Result:** The output is not a static shape, but a mathematically defined **mechanism trajectory** that satisfies all
  constraints throughout the motion.
