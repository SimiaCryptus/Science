# Agent Orchestration Language: Technical Overview

## Vision Statement

Current agent planning systems fundamentally underutilize agent capabilities by forcing them into rigid operational
boxes. Agents are far more flexible and adaptable than existing orchestration layers can express or leverage. This
language addresses the orchestration bottleneck by providing a type-safe, compositional framework that captures agent
flexibility while maintaining compile-time guarantees about feasibility, resource consumption, and domain expertise
alignment.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Agent Capabilities as Compositional Contracts

Agents are predefined instantiations with explicit compositional contracts rather than black-box functions. Each agent
declares its domains, reasoning capabilities, data scale handling, and resource characteristics in a machine-readable
contract that enables sophisticated orchestration reasoning.

### 2. Data Scale as First-Class Types

The type system includes primitive types that inherently carry semantic information about computational requirements and
processing strategies:

```typescript
type snippet = string    // ~100 chars, inline processing
type passage = text      // ~1K chars, single-pass operations  
type document = corpus   // ~10K chars, requires chunking
type collection = archive // ~100K+ chars, distributed processing
```

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Agent Characterization

Agents are typed across multiple capability dimensions:

```typescript
type Agent<D extends domain, R extends reasoning, S extends scale[]> = {
  domain_expertise: D,     // 'medical' | 'legal' | 'technical' | 'general'
  reasoning_level: R,      // 'recall' | 'analyze' | 'synthesize' | 'expert' | 'create'
  scale_capability: S,     // [snippet, passage, document, collection]
  resource_profile: ResourceProfile,
  compositional_constraints: CompositionRules
}
```

## Type System Architecture

### Primitive Data Types

The language includes scale-aware primitives that automatically inform processing strategies:

- **Text Scale**: `snippet`, `passage`, `document`, `collection`, `archive`
- **Structured Scale**: `record`, `dataset`, `warehouse`
- **Semi-structured Scale**: `fragment`, `content`, `knowledge`

### Resource Constraint Types

Budget constraints are expressed as first-class code constructs:

```typescript
type Budget = {
  tokens: number,
  time: Duration,
  cost: Currency,
  compute: ComputeUnits
}

within_budget(tokens: 10000, time: 30s, cost: $5.00) {
  // Compiler proves workflow stays within bounds
  return compose(agent.analyzer, agent.summarizer)(input_data)
}
```

### Agent Contract Declaration

```typescript
const agents = {
  medical_expert: Agent<{
    domains: ['medical', 'general'],
    reasoning: 'expert',
    input_types: [passage, document, collection],
    output_types: [snippet, passage, record],
    cost_model: TokenBased<0.01>,
    latency_profile: High,
    reliability: 0.95
  }>,
  
  technical_analyzer: Agent<{
    domains: ['technical'],
    reasoning: 'analyze',
    input_types: [document],
    output_types: [record<Schema>],
    cost_model: Fixed<2.00>,
    latency_profile: Low,
    reliability: 0.99
  }>
}
```

## Composition Algebra

### Core Composition Operators

**Sequential Composition (`>>`)**: Pipeline processing with automatic type alignment

```typescript
let pipeline = agent.extractor >> agent.analyzer >> agent.formatter
// Type: (input: document) => formatted_output
```

**Parallel Composition (`∥`)**: Simultaneous execution with result merging

```typescript
let consensus = agent.expert_a ∥ agent.expert_b ∥ agent.expert_c
// Resource cost: max(individual_costs)
```

**Choice Composition (`⊕`)**: Fallback chains with preference ordering

```typescript
let fallback = agent.fast_unreliable ⊕ agent.slow_reliable
// Resource bound: cheapest_successful_path
```

**Iterative Composition (`↻`)**: Feedback loops with convergence criteria

```typescript
let refined = agent.drafter ↻ agent.critic ↻ agent.reviser
// Resource multiplier: iteration_bounds
```

**Conditional Composition**: Runtime adaptation within type bounds

```typescript
let adaptive = input.complexity > threshold ? 
  agent.complex_reasoning : 
  agent.simple_processing
```

**Voting Composition**: Multi-agent consensus mechanisms

```typescript
let voted = vote_majority(agent.a, agent.b, agent.c)
let weighted = vote_weighted({agent.expert: 0.6, agent.novice: 0.4})
```

**Hierarchical Composition (`↗`)**: Escalation chains by capability level

```typescript
let escalated = agent.junior ↗ agent.senior ↗ agent.expert
// Automatic escalation based on confidence thresholds
```

### Composition Type Safety

The type system tracks multiple properties across compositions:

1. **Domain Compatibility**: Ensures domain expertise alignment
2. **Reasoning Sufficiency**: Verifies reasoning level requirements are met
3. **Scale Feasibility**: Confirms agents can handle data scales
4. **Resource Bounds**: Proves workflows stay within budget constraints
5. **Error Propagation**: Tracks failure modes and recovery strategies

## Compile-Time Orchestration Planning

### Constraint Satisfaction

The compiler functions as a sophisticated constraint solver that:

- Finds valid execution paths through agent capability graphs
- Optimizes resource allocation across composition structures
- Proves budget constraint satisfaction before execution
- Validates domain expertise and reasoning level requirements
- Identifies potential failure points and suggests mitigation strategies

### Automatic Agent Selection

Rather than manual agent specification, the system can infer optimal agent combinations:

```typescript
function analyze_medical_case(
  patient_data: collection<medical>,
  budget: Budget
): diagnosis<expert> {
  // Compiler automatically selects appropriate medical agents
  // that can handle collection-scale data within budget constraints
}
```

### Resource Planning

The type system performs static analysis to:

- Estimate token consumption across workflow paths
- Calculate expected latency through composition chains
- Determine compute requirements for different data scales
- Optimize parallel execution opportunities
- Plan fallback strategies for resource constraint violations

## Runtime Execution Model

### Contract Enforcement

Runtime monitors ensure agents operate within declared contracts:

- Domain expertise validation through output analysis
- Reasoning level verification through meta-cognitive assessment
- Resource consumption tracking and budget enforcement
- Performance monitoring against declared reliability metrics

### Dynamic Adaptation

While maintaining contract bounds, agents can adapt strategies based on:

- Input characteristics and complexity
- Available computational resources
- Real-time performance feedback
- Confidence levels and uncertainty quantification

### Failure Recovery

Built-in resilience patterns handle:

- Agent unavailability through automatic substitution
- Quality degradation through reasoning level adjustment
- Resource exhaustion through composition simplification
- Domain mismatch through expert agent escalation

## Implementation Considerations

### Agent Integration Layer

Standardized interfaces for:

- Contract declaration and capability advertisement
- Input/output type validation and transformation
- Resource consumption reporting and budget tracking
- Performance metrics and reliability assessment

### Compiler Architecture

Multi-pass compilation process:

1. **Contract Resolution**: Match agent capabilities to workflow requirements
2. **Type Checking**: Validate composition type safety and domain alignment
3. **Resource Analysis**: Prove budget constraints and optimize allocation
4. **Execution Planning**: Generate optimized execution graphs with fallback paths
5. **Code Generation**: Produce executable orchestration code with monitoring

### Runtime Infrastructure

Distributed execution environment supporting:

- Parallel agent invocation with result synchronization
- Resource pool management and dynamic scaling
- Contract monitoring and violation detection
- Performance analytics and capability learning

## Future Extensions

### Meta-Learning Capabilities

- Agent contract evolution based on observed performance
- Automatic capability discovery through interaction analysis
- Dynamic expertise assessment and domain expansion

### Advanced Composition Patterns

- Auction-based agent selection for cost optimization
- Swarm orchestration for massively parallel processing
- Hierarchical agent societies with emergent specialization

### Domain-Specific Extensions

- Specialized type systems for particular domains (medical, legal, financial)
- Custom composition operators for domain-specific workflow patterns
- Regulatory compliance verification for sensitive domains

## Conclusion

This orchestration language transforms agent coordination from rigid procedural programming into flexible, type-safe
capability composition. By making agent capabilities, resource constraints, and domain expertise first-class citizens in
the type system, it enables sophisticated reasoning about complex agent workflows while maintaining safety and
predictability guarantees.

The result is an orchestration layer that can fully leverage agent flexibility while providing the reliability and cost
predictability required for production systems.
