### System Responsibilities

- **Voice Input Processing**: Capture and process voice commands with <500ms latency
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parse developer intent and technical context
- **Task Orchestration**: Route requests to appropriate external systems
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provide voice and visual feedback on task execution
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation history and project context
- **Security & Compliance**: Enforce authentication, authorization, and data privacy

and Data Science Agent system. The design emphasizes:

1. **Scalability**: Microservices architecture with horizontal scaling capabilities
2. **Performance**: <500ms latency for voice processing with edge computing
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with multi-region active-active deployment
4. **Security**: End-to-end encryption, OAuth 2.0, RBAC, and comprehensive audit logging
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, comprehensive monitoring, and documentation
6. **Extensibility**: Plugin-based integration framework for external systems

The system is designed to support thousands of concurrent users while maintaining high performance and reliability
standards. All architectural decisions are documented with clear rationale and consequences, enabling informed future
modifications and enhancements.

### 8.2 Query Optimization Guidelines

```markdown
## Query Optimization Best Practices

### 1. Use Appropriate Indexes
- Always use indexed columns in WHERE clauses
- Use composite indexes for multi-column filters
- Avoid index on low-cardinality columns
- Monitor index usage and remove unused indexes

### 2. Optimize JOIN Operations
- Join on indexed columns
- Use INNER JOIN when possible
- Avoid multiple LEFT JOINs
- Consider denormalization for frequently joined tables

### 3. Pagination Strategy
- Use OFFSET/LIMIT for pagination
- Consider keyset pagination for large datasets
- Avoid SELECT * queries
- Specify only needed columns

### 4. Aggregation Optimization
- Use GROUP BY with indexed columns
- Consider materialized views for complex aggregations
- Use HAVING clause after GROUP BY
- Avoid aggregations in WHERE clause

### 5. Subquery Optimization
- Use JOINs instead of subqueries when possible
- Use EXISTS instead of IN for large datasets
- Consider CTEs for complex queries
- Avoid correlated subqueries

### 6. Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use Redis for session data
- Implement query result caching
- Set appropriate TTL values

### 7. Monitoring & Analysis
- Monitor slow query logs
- Analyze query execution plans
- Track query performance metrics
- Identify bottlenecks regularly
```
