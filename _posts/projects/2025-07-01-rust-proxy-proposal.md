## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical architecture for a high-performance SOCKS proxy written in Rust that intercepts, analyzes, and optionally transforms application traffic across multiple protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, Redis, PostgreSQL). The system provides comprehensive traffic visibility through a searchable database backend and supports logical traffic rewriting capabilities.

## Market Analysis

### Competitive Landscape

The application traffic monitoring and observability space contains several established players, but with distinct gaps that our solution addresses:

#### Direct Competitors

**Enterprise Security Solutions:**
- **Broadcom ProxySG**: Enterprise-focused with SOCKS support, primarily for security rather than development observability
- **Burp Suite Professional**: Web application security testing with HTTP/HTTPS interception, limited to security use cases
- **Charles Proxy/Proxyman**: HTTP debugging tools for developers, platform-specific and HTTP-only

**Limitations**: Security-focused, HTTP-only, platform constraints, no database protocol support

#### Adjacent Competitors - API Observability

**Cloud-Native Platforms:**
- **Moesif**: Comprehensive API analytics with REST/GraphQL support, cloud-hosted SaaS model
- **Tyk API Gateway**: Full lifecycle API management with built-in monitoring
- **AWS CloudWatch + API Gateway**: Native AWS monitoring, vendor lock-in
- **Azure API Management**: Microsoft's observability platform, Azure-specific

**Open Source Solutions:**
- **SigNoz**: Open-source observability platform, primarily metrics-focused
- **Jaeger/Zipkin**: Distributed tracing, requires application instrumentation

**Limitations**: Cloud vendor lock-in, HTTP-only protocols, require gateway deployment or code changes, limited transformation capabilities

### Market Differentiation

#### Unique Value Proposition

**Multi-Protocol Support**: Unlike competitors focused solely on HTTP/HTTPS, our solution provides unified visibility across web APIs and database communications (Redis, PostgreSQL), capturing the complete application data flow.

**Transparent Integration**: SOCKS proxy approach eliminates the need for API gateway deployment, application code changes, or cloud platform dependencies. Applications simply configure proxy settings.

**Real-Time Transformation**: Active traffic modification capabilities (token proxying, JSON translation) go beyond passive monitoring to enable environment adaptation and API versioning support.

**Cross-Platform Standalone**: Single binary deployment across all major platforms without runtime dependencies or cloud hosting requirements.

#### Target Market Segments

**Primary Market - Development Teams:**
- Microservices debugging and integration testing
- API contract validation between services

## Detailed Implementation

### SOCKS Proxy Core

```rust
// Core proxy structure
pub struct ProxyServer {
    listener: TcpListener,
    config: ProxyConfig,
    traffic_recorder: Arc<TrafficRecorder>,
    transformer: Arc<TrafficTransformer>,
    mode: ProxyMode,
}
pub enum ProxyMode {
    Socks { auth: Option<AuthConfig> },
    DirectHttp {
        upstream_mappings: HashMap<String, UpstreamTarget>,
        default_upstream: Option<UpstreamTarget>,
    },
}
pub struct UpstreamTarget {
    pub host: String,
    pub port: u16,
    pub use_tls: bool,
    pub health_check_path: Option<String>,
}

// Connection handling
async fn handle_socks_connection(
    stream: TcpStream,
    recorder: Arc<TrafficRecorder>,
    transformer: Arc<TrafficTransformer>,
) -> Result<(), ProxyError>
// Direct HTTP connection handling
async fn handle_http_connection(
    stream: TcpStream,
    upstream_mappings: Arc<HashMap<String, UpstreamTarget>>,
    default_upstream: Option<Arc<UpstreamTarget>>,
    recorder: Arc<TrafficRecorder>,
    transformer: Arc<TrafficTransformer>,
) -> Result<(), ProxyError>
```

**Key Features:**
- Concurrent connection handling with per-connection tasks
- SOCKS protocol negotiation and authentication
- Transparent traffic interception with minimal latency impact
- Graceful error handling and connection cleanup
- Direct HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy mode with path-based routing
- Health check support for upstream targets

### Protocol Detection and Parsing

#### HTTP/HTTPS Handler
- Request/response parsing with header extraction
- Body content analysis for JSON/XML payloads
- Cookie and authentication token detection
- Compression handling (gzip, deflate, brotli)

#### Redis Protocol Handler
- RESP protocol parsing for commands and responses
- Command categorization (read/write/admin)
- Key pattern extraction for data flow analysis
- Pipeline and transaction support

#### PostgreSQL Protocol Handler
- Wire protocol message parsing
- Query extraction and parameter binding
- Result set metadata capture
- Transaction state tracking

### Traffic Transformation Engine

```rust
pub trait TrafficTransformer: Send + Sync {
    async fn transform_request(&self, request: &mut Request) -> Result<(), TransformError>;
    async fn transform_response(&self, response: &mut Response) -> Result<(), TransformError>;
}
```

**Transformation Capabilities:**
- **Token Proxying**: Dynamic credential injection based on target service
- **JSON Schema Translation**: Field mapping and type conversion
- **Header Manipulation**: Custom header injection and filtering
- **Content Rewriting**: Regex-based content substitution

### Performance Optimizations

#### Memory Management
- Zero-copy buffer operations using `bytes::Bytes`
- Connection pooling for upstream services
- Efficient parser state machines to minimize allocations
- Pre-compiled transformation rule sets for common patterns

#### Async I/O Strategy
- Separate async tasks for read/write operations
- Buffered I/O with configurable buffer sizes
- Backpressure handling for high-throughput scenarios

#### Latency Optimization
- **Bypass Mode**: <1ms for configured addresses (no parsing, direct proxy)
- **Fast Path**: <10ms for simple requests (connection reuse, minimal parsing, cached rules)
- **Standard Path**: <100ms for complex requests (full parsing, transformation)
- Connection keep-alive and HTTP/2 support where applicable
- Hash-based cache for "safe to bypass" request patterns

### Data Storage and Indexing

#### Traffic Recording Schema
```rust
pub struct TrafficRecord {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub connection_id: String,
    pub protocol: Protocol,
    pub source_addr: SocketAddr,
    pub destination_addr: SocketAddr,
    pub request_data: CompressedData,
    pub response_data: Option<CompressedData>,
    pub metadata: TrafficMetadata,
}
pub struct CompressedData {
    pub format: CompressionFormat,
    pub size_original: u64,
    pub size_compressed: u64,
    pub data: Vec<u8>,  // Compressed bytes
    pub sampling_applied: bool,
}
pub enum CompressionFormat {
    Zstd,     // Primary: best compression ratio
    Lz4,      // Fast path: low latency compression
    None,     // Small payloads < 1KB
}
```

#### Async Recording Pipeline

#### Storage Optimization Strategy

##### Compression Pipeline
- **Adaptive Compression**: Choose algorithm based on payload size and CPU availability
  - LZ4 for real-time compression (>10MB/s throughput)
  - Zstandard for batch/background compression (3:1 to 10:1 ratios)
  - Skip compression for payloads < 1KB
- **Streaming Compression**: Process data in chunks to avoid memory spikes
- **Dictionary Training**: Build protocol-specific compression dictionaries for better ratios

##### Data Sampling and Filtering
```rust
pub struct SamplingConfig {
    pub max_body_size: usize,           // Truncate bodies larger than this
    pub sampling_rate: f32,             // 0.0-1.0, percentage of requests to store
    pub always_sample_errors: bool,     // Always store 4xx/5xx responses
    pub sensitive_data_rules: Vec<RedactionRule>,
}
```

- **Smart Truncation**: Store headers + first/last N bytes of large bodies
- **Deduplication**: Hash-based detection of repeated requests/responses
- **Selective Storage**: Configurable rules for what to store (errors only, specific endpoints)

##### Archival and Tiering
```yaml
storage:
  retention:
    hot_tier:
      duration: "7d"
      compression: "lz4"
      indexes: ["timestamp", "endpoint", "status_code"]

    warm_tier:
      duration: "30d"
      compression: "zstd"
      indexes: ["timestamp", "endpoint"]
      downsample_rate: 0.1  # Keep 10% of successful requests

    cold_tier:
      duration: "365d"
      compression: "zstd_max"
      indexes: ["timestamp"]
      storage_backend: "s3"  # Move to object storage
```

##### Indexing Strategy

**Primary Indexes**:
- `timestamp` + `connection_id` (clustered, for time-series queries)
- `protocol` + `destination_addr` (for service-specific queries)
- `status_code` + `timestamp` (for error analysis)

**Secondary Indexes**:
- `request_path` (extracted from HTTP, partial index on first 64 chars)
- `response_time_ms` (bucketed: <10ms, 10-100ms, 100-1000ms, >1000ms)
- `payload_size_bucket` (small/medium/large/xlarge)

**Full-Text Search**:
- Separate search index for request/response headers only
- Async indexing pipeline to avoid impacting proxy performance
- Configurable fields to index (URLs, specific headers, error messages)

**Partitioning Strategy**:
```sql
-- Time-based partitioning for efficient archival
CREATE TABLE traffic_records_2024_01 PARTITION OF traffic_records
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

-- Automatic partition management
-- Drop partitions older than retention period
-- Pre-create future partitions
-- Upstream health status updates
```

##### Storage Metrics and Monitoring
- Real-time compression ratio tracking
- Storage growth rate projections
- Query performance metrics by index
- Automatic alerts for storage threshold breaches
