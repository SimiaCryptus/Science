# DAG-Based Patch Format Specification

## Overview

A patch format designed for machine consumption and LLM processing that represents code changes as a directed acyclic
graph of transform operations rather than line-based diffs.

## Core Architecture

### Base Representation

- **Tar archive** as baseline container for file state
- Preserves file structure, metadata, and binary content
- Content-addressable storage for deduplication

### Delta Encoding

- Changes expressed as operations on the tar archive
- Operations form a DAG showing true dependencies
- No artificial sequential ordering

## Transform Operations

### Primitive Operations

- **Copy** - Duplicate content within or across files
- **Move** - Relocate content, preserving identity
- **Delete** - Remove content
- **Reorder** - Change sequence without modification
- **String Replace** - Regex-based substitution patterns
- **Whitespace** - Isolated formatting changes (indentation, line endings, trailing spaces)
- **Binary Delta** - Fallback for arbitrary changes

### Operation Properties

Each operation node contains:

- Unique identifier (content-addressed hash)
- Operation type
- Source and target references
- Dependencies (edges in DAG)
- Metadata (optional: intent, semantic tags)

## DAG Structure

### Dependency Model

- Nodes represent operations
- Edges represent true causal dependencies
- Operation B depends on A only if B requires A's output state
- Independent operations have no edges between them

### Benefits

- **Parallelization** - Apply independent branches concurrently
- **Partial Application** - Cherry-pick subgraphs safely
- **Conflict Detection** - Identify incompatible dependencies
- **Merge Intelligence** - Combine patches via graph union
- **Causality Preservation** - Explicit ordering only where required

## Auto-Regression Algorithm

### Factorization Process

Given a large commit (before/after state):

1. **Whitespace Isolation** - Extract all formatting changes first
2. **Pattern Detection** - Identify repeated transformations (renames, refactors)
3. **Operation Discovery** - Find minimal set of transforms
4. **Dependency Analysis** - Build DAG from causal relationships
5. **Optimization** - Minimize total description length

### Optimization Metrics

- **Description Length** - Total bytes to represent all operations
- **Consistency** - Semantic coherence of operation groupings
- **Reusability** - Favor decompositions matching known patterns
- **Compression Ratio** - Operations vs equivalent binary delta

## Use Cases

### LLM Integration

- Understand semantic intent of changes
- Generate similar refactoring patterns
- Compose new patches from operation libraries
- Automated code review with causal reasoning

### Tooling Applications

- Intelligent merge conflict resolution
- Parallel patch application
- Change impact analysis
- Pattern-based code search
- Incremental verification and bisection

### Version Control

- Efficient storage (compression via transform reuse)
- Fast cherry-picking (subgraph extraction)
- Better blame tracking (operation-level attribution)
- Semantic diff comparisons

## Implementation Considerations

### Format Properties

- Binary-safe throughout
- Content-addressable operations enable deduplication
- Self-contained (references to file states included)
- Extensible (new operation types can be added)

### Tool Responsibilities

Format is substrate only. Intelligence lives in tools:

- **Writers** - Generate optimal factorizations
- **Readers** - Apply operations, resolve dependencies
- **Mergers** - Combine DAGs, detect conflicts
- **Analyzers** - Extract patterns, compute metrics

No formal grammar required. Operations are data, not a language to parse.

## Example Structure

```
 Patch {
  base_tar: <content-hash>
  operations: [
    {
      id: <hash-1>
      type: "whitespace"
      intent: "normalize-indentation"
      semantic_tags: ["formatting", "non-functional"]
      description: "Normalize Python indentation to 4 spaces"
      author: "system"
      timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      confidence: 1.0
      reversible: true
      breaking_change: false
      affected_domains: ["style"]
      scope: ["**/*.py"]
      transform: <normalize-indentation>
      depends_on: []
    },
    {
      id: <hash-2>
      type: "move"
      source: "utils.py:Foo"
      intent: "refactor-module-organization"
      semantic_tags: ["refactoring", "structural"]
      description: "Move Foo class to helpers module for better organization"
      author: "developer"
      timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      confidence: 0.95
      reversible: true
      breaking_change: false
      affected_domains: ["architecture", "imports"]
      target: "helpers.py:Foo"
      depends_on: []
    },
    {
      id: <hash-3>
      type: "string_replace"
      pattern: "import.*Foo.*from utils"
      intent: "update-imports-after-move"
      semantic_tags: ["refactoring", "import-update"]
      description: "Update import statements to reflect Foo class relocation"
      author: "system"
      timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      confidence: 0.98
      reversible: true
      breaking_change: false
      affected_domains: ["imports"]
      replacement: "import Foo from helpers"
      scope: ["src/**/*.py"]
      depends_on: [<hash-2>]
    },
    {
      id: <hash-4>
      type: "binary_delta"
      target: "main.py"
      intent: "logic-update"
      semantic_tags: ["feature", "logic-change"]
      description: "Update main.py logic to use refactored Foo class"
      author: "developer"
      timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      confidence: 0.85
      reversible: true
      breaking_change: false
      affected_domains: ["logic", "behavior"]
      delta: <compressed-diff>
      depends_on: [<hash-3>]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Extensions

- **Semantic fingerprinting** - Build libraries of common patterns
- **Diff-of-diffs** - Compare patches by DAG structure
- **Probabilistic operations** - LLM-suggested transforms with confidence scores
- **Verification hooks** - Checkpoint validation at DAG nodes
- **Cross-repository patterns** - Reuse transforms across codebases
