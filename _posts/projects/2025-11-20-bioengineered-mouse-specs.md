## Target Diet Composition

- **Primary (45-55%):** Cellulosic waste (food scraps, paper, yard waste, agricultural residue)
- **Secondary (20-30%):** Pest insects (flies, roaches, moths, beetles, gnats)
- **Tertiary (10-15%):** Spoiled/contaminated organic matter (utilizing vulture pathogen resistance)
- **Polymer Component (5-10%):** Plastic waste (PET bottles, polyethylene bags, food packaging)
- **Supplemental (5-10%):** General organic matter

## Physical Specifications

**Indeterminate Growth System:**

- Fish-derived growth hormone pathways for continuous size scaling
- Salmon growth factor genes for extended growth periods
- Environmental nutrient-responsive growth regulation
- Size ranges from 25g (juvenile workers) to 200g+ (harvest-ready adults)

**Age-Based Functionality:**

- **Juveniles (25-45g, 6-16 weeks):** High mobility, crack/crevice waste access, pest hunting specialists
- **Adults (45-80g, 16-40 weeks):** Primary waste processors, optimal work capacity
- **Harvesters (80-200g+, 40+ weeks):** Premium protein yield, reduced activity, fattening phase

**Scalable Meat Quality:**

## Behavioral Modifications

**Collection & Management:**

- Docile temperament genes from domestic breeds
- Enhanced social clustering behavior with size-based hierarchy
- Pheromone-responsive attraction systems

- Programmed return behavior to feeding stations
- Size-selective harvesting compatibility

**Feeding Behavior:**

- Age-appropriate diet preferences (juveniles prefer insects, adults prefer bulk waste)
- Efficient foraging strategies that scale with body size
- Coordinated feeding behavior in mixed-age groups
- Territorial behavior reduces with size (larger mice become less mobile)

## Product Outputs

### Bio-Fertilizer Pellets

**Production Rate:** 8-12g per mouse per day
**Composition:**

- NPK ratio: 12-8-2 (enhanced from bat guano genetics)
- Micronutrients: Calcium, magnesium, sulfur, trace minerals
- Active chitinase enzymes (insecticidal properties)
- Concentrated plant alkaloids (pest deterrent)
- Beneficial soil bacteria from gut microbiome

**Insecticidal Properties:**

- Residual chitinase activity disrupts insect molting
- Natural alkaloid concentrations (0.3-0.8% dry weight)
- Bacterial spores producing insect-specific toxins
- Fatty acid profiles toxic to soft-bodied pests

### Protein Harvest

**Yield:** 25-35g dressed weight per mouse
**Quality Characteristics:**

- High protein content (24% by weight)
- Omega-3 enriched from insect diet
- Low saturated fat profile
- Enhanced flavor compounds from processed organic matter

## Operational Parameters

### Environment Requirements

**Optimal Conditions:**

- Temperature: 18-24°C
- Humidity: 45-65% RH
- Substrate depth: 15-30cm organic waste
- Population density: 50-75 mice per cubic meter of waste

### Waste Processing Capacity

**Size-Scaled Performance:**

- **Juveniles (25-45g):** Process 8-12g waste/day, excel at pest hunting and tight space access
- **Adults (45-80g):** Process 18-25g waste/day, optimal efficiency for bulk processing
- **Harvesters (80-200g+):** Process 15-20g waste/day, focus on high-value waste conversion

**Adaptive Colony Dynamics:**

- Population naturally stratifies by age and function
- Juvenile recruitment maintains processing capacity
- Adult population provides stable bulk processing
- Harvester cohorts provide predictable protein yields
- Colony adapts size distribution to waste composition

**Colony Performance (1000 mice, mixed ages):**

- Processes 20-30kg organic waste daily (varied by size distribution)
- Degrades 3-6kg plastic waste daily
- Produces 15-20kg bio-fertilizer daily
- Eliminates 12,000-20,000 pest insects daily (juveniles excel)
- Yields 40-60kg harvestable protein monthly (from harvester cohort)
- Maintains 60% juveniles/adults (workers) + 40% harvesters (protein source)

## Reproductive Specifications

**Scalable Breeding System:**

- Accelerated sexual maturity (6 weeks, at 35-40g)
- Increased litter size scaling with female size (6-8 pups at 45g, up to 12-15 at 100g+)
- Enhanced maternal care behaviors improve with age/size
- Survival rates improve with colony age structure (95%+ to weaning)
- Growth rate responsive to food availability and waste richness

**Population Management:**

- Market expansion for bio-products
- Regulatory approval pathways

## Safety & Containment

**Triple-Redundant Reproductive Control System:**

**Primary Pathway - Hormonal Dependency:**

- Engineered requirement for synthetic GnRH analog for reproductive hormone cascade
- Modified hypothalamic-pituitary axis requiring artificial hormone trigger
- Natural reproductive hormones insufficient for successful breeding

**Secondary Pathway - Gamete Maturation Block:**

- Engineered dependency on synthetic vitamin E analog for sperm/egg development
- Modified steroidogenesis pathway requiring artificial cofactor
- Reproductive cells fail to mature without supplement

**Tertiary Pathway - Implantation Dependency:**

- Modified progesterone receptors requiring synthetic progesterone analog
- Engineered uterine receptivity dependent on artificial hormone
- Fertilization may occur but implantation fails without supplement

**Triple-Supplement Breeding Protocol:**

- All three synthetic compounds required simultaneously for successful reproduction
- Short half-life design (24-48 hours) requiring continuous supplementation
- Different metabolic pathways prevent single supplement from bypassing all blocks
- Compounds not naturally occurring in environment

**Failure Analysis:**

- **Single pathway mutation:** Breeding still blocked by remaining two pathways
- **Double pathway mutation:** Extremely rare, still blocked by third pathway
- **Triple pathway mutation:** Statistically negligible probability across population
- **Selective pressure:** Non-breeding mice cannot pass on "resistance" mutations

**Breeding Center Operations:**

- Continuous monitoring of all three supplement levels
- Regular genetic testing to verify pathway integrity
- Separate production and quality control of all three compounds
- Backup supply chains for each synthetic supplement

**Risk Mitigation:**

- Independent biochemical pathways reduce correlated failure risk
- Different molecular targets prevent single resistance mechanism
- Multiple suppliers for synthetic compounds prevent supply chain failure
- Regular pathway functionality testing in breeding populations

## Economic Projections

**Revenue Streams:**

1. Waste processing services: $3-7 per kg waste processed (premium for plastic component)
2. Premium bio-fertilizer sales: $15-25 per kg
3. Plastic waste processing: $5-15 per kg plastic waste
4. Pest control service reduction: $500-1500 per facility monthly
5. Protein harvest: $8-12 per kg dressed weight
6. Carbon credit potential: $10-50 per tonne CO2 equivalent

**Break-even Analysis:**

- Initial colony setup: $50,000-75,000
- Monthly operating costs: $2,000-3,500
- Revenue potential: $8,000-15,000 monthly per 1000-mouse colony
- ROI timeline: 8-14 months

## Regulatory Considerations
