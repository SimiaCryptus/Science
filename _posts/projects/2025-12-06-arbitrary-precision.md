# Design Document: Kotlin Exact Real Arithmetic Toolkit

## 1. Overview
This library provides a framework for **Constructive Real Arithmetic** in Kotlin. Unlike standard floating-point libraries (IEEE 754) or standard arbitrary-precision libraries (`BigDecimal`), this toolkit treats numbers as **computable functions** rather than static bit patterns.

A Real number is defined not by its value, but by the genealogy of operations that created it. Precision is not decided at creation time; it is decided at **evaluation time**.

## 2. Core Philosophy
1.  **Exactness by Default:** Intermediate operations (addition, multiplication, composition) are symbolic and introduce no rounding errors.
2.  **Lazy Evaluation:** Computation is deferred until a specific precision is requested (e.g., "Give me $\pi$ to 10,000 decimal places").
3.  **Explicit Precision Context:** The user defines the required precision only when extracting data (converting to String or Byte stream).
4.  **No Equality:** Due to the undecidability of the "Zero Determination Problem" in exact arithmetic, strict equality checks (`==`) are not supported for Real numbers.

## 3. Type Hierarchy

The library is built on a strict mathematical hierarchy.

### 3.1 `KInteger` (Exact)
*   **Backing:** Wraps `java.math.BigInteger`.
*   **Precision:** Infinite magnitude, exact precision (scale 0).
*   **Behavior:** Acts as the atomic unit of the system.

### 3.2 `KRational` (Exact)
*   **Backing:** A pair of `KInteger`s (numerator $p$, denominator $q$).
*   **Behavior:** Automatically simplifies fractions ($2/4 \to 1/2$). Handles all basic arithmetic ($+, -, *, /$) exactly without loss of precision.
*   **Role:** The bridge between discrete math and continuous math.

### 3.3 `KReal` (Computed)
*   **Backing:** An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) / Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing the computation history.
*   **Behavior:** Lazy. Represents values like $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, $e$, or $sin(10^{50})$.
*   **Interface:**
    *   `KInteger` and `KRational` implement the `KReal` interface.
    *   Operations on `KReal` return new `KReal` nodes (building the tree).

## 4. Architecture & Memory Model

### 4.1 The Genealogy Tree
Every operation creates a new node in a computation graph.
*   **Leaf Nodes:** Constants (`KInteger`, `KRational`, Predefined Constants like $\pi$).
*   **Composite Nodes:** Operations (`AddNode`, `MultNode`, `SinNode`, `ExpNode`).

**Example:**
```kotlin
val a = KReal(2)
val b = a.sqrt()
val c = b + KReal.PI
// c is not a number yet; it is a tree: Add(Sqrt(2), PI)
```

### 4.2 Memory Strategy ("Let it Explode")
*   **Current State:** The library does not automatically prune, simplify, or checkpoint the expression tree.
*   **Implication:** Iterative algorithms (loops) will increase tree depth linearly.
*   **User Responsibility:** If the user creates a loop of 1,000,000 iterations, the library will construct a tree 1,000,000 nodes deep. Evaluation may cause a `StackOverflowError` or `OutOfMemoryError`.
*   **Future Optimization:** Explicit `checkpoint()` methods may be added later to force intermediate evaluation and collapse the tree.

## 5. Algorithmic Implementation

To ensure performance at high precision, the library avoids naive Taylor series where possible, favoring quadratically convergent algorithms.

### 5.1 Fundamental Operations
*   **Addition/Subtraction:** Exact for Rationals; propagates precision demand for Reals.
*   **Multiplication:** Karatsuba or Schönhage-Strassen (via underlying BigInt implementation).
*   **Division:** Newton-Raphson iteration (computes $1/x$ and multiplies).

### 5.2 Transcendental Functions
*   **Square Root:** Newton's Method ($x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(x_n + \frac{S}{x_n})$).
*   **Pi ($\pi$):** Chudnovsky Algorithm or Gauss-Legendre (AGM).
*   **Exp / Log:** Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AGM) based transformations.
*   **Trigonometry:**
    *   **Argument Reduction:** Reduce large inputs using a high-precision $\pi$.
    *   **Calculation:** Taylor series (for small arguments) or Newton iteration on inverse trig functions.
### 5.3 Periodic Precision & Composability
To handle Rationals and similar fields exactly, the library accounts for **periodic precision generation**.
*   **Cycle Detection:** Division operations track remainders to identify repeating decimal cycles (e.g., $1/7 \to \overline{142857}$).
*   **Composability:** Operations between two periodic numbers (Rational + Rational) synthesize a new periodic sequence by computing the LCM of cycle lengths, maintaining exactness without falling back to generic infinite streams.


## 6. API Specification (Kotlin)

### 6.1 Construction
```kotlin
val i = 100.toKInteger()
val r = "1.2345".toKRational() // Parses to 12345/10000
val x = KReal.PI
val y = KReal.E
```

### 6.2 Operations
Standard Kotlin operator overloading is used.
```kotlin
val res = (x * 2) + (y.pow(2)) - (i / 3)
val trig = x.sin() * x.cos()
```

### 6.3 Comparison (The "No Equality" Rule)
The `equals()` / `==` method will throw `UnsupportedOperationException` for `KReal`.

**Supported Comparisons:**
```kotlin
// Check if x > y (may run forever if x is extremely close to y)
if (x > y) { ... }

// Check if x is effectively equal to y within a specific tolerance
if (x.eq(y, precision = 100)) { ... } // Checks 100 bits of precision
```

### 6.4 Evaluation & Output
This is where the work happens.

```kotlin
// 1. Get a string representation to specific decimal places
val str = x.toString(precision = 500) // 500 decimal digits

// 2. Get a standard Double (lossy)
val dbl = x.toDouble()

// 3. Generate an infinite sequence of digits
val digits: Sequence<Int> = x.digitStream()
digits.take(1000).forEach { print(it) }
```

## 7. Internal Representation: The `PrecisionContext`

When `eval()` is called, a `PrecisionContext` is passed down the tree.

1.  **Request:** User asks for `x` to 100 bits.
2.  **Propagation:**
    *   If `x = a + b`, `x` might ask `a` and `b` for 105 bits (guard digits to prevent error accumulation).
    *   If `x = a * b`, precision demands are dynamic based on the magnitude of operands.
3.  **Calculation:** Leaf nodes return `BigFloat` (Mantissa + Exponent) approximations.

## 8. Roadmap & Limitations

1.  **Zero Detection:** Checking if a number is exactly zero is theoretically impossible for general constructive reals. The library assumes non-zero unless proven otherwise within a computation limit.
2.  **Performance:** Deep recursion trees will be slow.
3.  **Caching:** Currently, re-evaluating `x` at a higher precision recalculates from scratch. Future versions will implement memoization to reuse previous lower-precision computations.
