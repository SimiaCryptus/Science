We propose a novel Mamba-based architecture that enables persistent integration of external knowledge through cached
semantic transforms embedded directly in structured state spaces. By leveraging Mamba's linear scaling and selective
state mechanisms, this approach transforms document knowledge into dynamic state representations that can be efficiently
maintained and selectively activated during generation, achieving near-instantaneous access to vast knowledge
repositories without the quadratic scaling limitations of attention-based approaches.
